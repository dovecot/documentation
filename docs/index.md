# Dovecot Community Edition (CE)

Dovecot is an open source email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems,
written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for
both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires
no special administration and it uses very little memory.

Dovecot supports the IMAP ([[rfc,3501]]), POP3 ([[rfc,1939]]), LMTP
([[rfc,2033]]), and ManageSieve ([[rfc,5228]]) mail protocols.

## Dovecot Pro

[Dovecot Pro](https://www.open-xchange.com/portfolio/ox-dovecot-pro/) is
a commercial software product of [Open-Xchange](https://www.open-xchange.com/).

Dovecot Pro implements Palomar, a cloud-native architecture that allows for
Dovecot to be highly available, scalable, and stateless.

Dovecot Pro uses Dovecot core as part of the architecture.
