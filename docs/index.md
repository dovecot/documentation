# Dovecot Community Edition (CE)

<DovecotLogo />

<hr />

Dovecot is an open source email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems,
written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for
both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires
no special administration and it uses very little memory.

Dovecot supports the IMAP ([[rfc,3501]]), POP3 ([[rfc,1939]]), LMTP
([[rfc,2033]]), and ManageSieve ([[rfc,5228]]) mail protocols.

## Dovecot Pro

[Dovecot Pro](https://www.open-xchange.com/portfolio/ox-dovecot-pro/) is
a commercial software product of [Open-Xchange](https://www.open-xchange.com/).

Dovecot Pro implements Palomar, a cloud-native architecture that allows for
Dovecot to be highly available, scalable, and stateless.

Dovecot Pro uses Dovecot Core as part of the Palomar architecture.

## Dovecot Community Edition

[Dovecot Community Edition (CE)](https://www.dovecot.org/) is the open source
version of Dovecot.

Dovecot CE is designed for use on a single server. There is no support or
maintenance for multiple Dovecot servers to interact with each other.

This site fully documents Dovecot CE and its behavior.

Dovecot CE is also referred to as "Dovecot Core" in this documentation.
