# Upgrading Dovecot CE 2.3 to 2.3.x

## Dovecot CE

### v2.3.x to v2.3.14

* Removed cydir storage format. It was never intended for production use.
* Removed snarf plugin. It was for UW-IMAP's mbox compatibility, which is
  unlikely to be needed anymore.
* Removed mail_filter plugin. It was mainly intended as an example plugin.
