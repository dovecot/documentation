#### Event Filters

Size units are allowed when specifying event filter values. For example,
`100kb` is accepted as equivalent to `102400`.

Interval units are allowed when specifying event filter values. For
example, `1min` is accepted as equivalent to `60000000`.

Event filters support escaping wildcard `*` and `?` characters by prefixing
them with `\`.
