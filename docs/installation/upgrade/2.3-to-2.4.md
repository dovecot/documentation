# Upgrading Dovecot CE from 2.3 to 2.4

## Upgrade Path

Before upgrading, please look at the list of removed features carefully.

If you are doing in-place upgrade, ensure that you first upgrade to latest
2.3 release, and then upgrade to 2.4.

Alternatively, you can [[link,migrating_mailboxes,migrate]] your data to new
setup.

## Dovecot CE

### Deprecated Features

| Feature | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| fs-sis | Saving new mails' attachments via fs-sis is disabled, but reading SIS attachments is still supported. Missing SIS attachments are replaced with files filled with spaces. |

### Removed Features

| Feature | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| fts-lucene, fts-squat | Use [[plugin,fts-flatcurve]] or [[plugin,fts-solr]]. |
| dsync: Remove -D parameter | Parameter for disabling mailbox rename syncing removed. It hasn't been necessary for a long time, and it is broken. |
| dsync | Use `doveadm sync` instead. `dsync` has been a symlink to `doveadm` already, this release removed the symlink completely. |
| director | Support for the Dovecot Director architecture has been removed. For a small-scale, unsupported replacement, see [[link,lua_director]]. |
| replicator | Use [[link,nfs]] or some other shared filesystem instead. |
