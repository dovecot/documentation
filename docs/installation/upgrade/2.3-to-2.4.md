# Upgrading Dovecot CE from 2.3 to 2.4

## Upgrade Path

Before upgrading, please look at the list of removed features carefully.

If you are doing in-place upgrade, ensure that you first upgrade to latest
2.3 release, and then upgrade to 2.4.

Alternatively, you can [[link,migrating_mailboxes,migrate]] your data to new
setup.

## Example Configuration

The old v2.3 example configuration has been converted to v2.4 once. It's not
being kept up-to-date afterwards, but it can be helpful:
https://github.com/dovecot/tools/blob/main/dovecot-2.4.0-example-config.tar.gz

### Removed Features

| Feature | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| fts-lucene, fts-squat | Use [[plugin,fts-flatcurve]] or [[plugin,fts-solr]]. |
| dsync: Remove -D parameter | Parameter for disabling mailbox rename syncing removed. It hasn't been necessary for a long time, and it is broken. |

| director | Support for the Dovecot Director architecture has been removed. For a small-scale, unsupported replacement, see [[link,lua_director]]. |
| replicator | Use [[link,nfs]] or some other shared filesystem instead. |

## Upgrade Tips

### Mailbox Location

::: warning
These are examples of some common conversions. You MUST adjust the specific
examples to your own environment.
:::

```diff
-mail_home = /home/vmail/%u
+mail_home = /home/vmail/%{user}
```

```diff
-mail_home = /home/vmail/%d/%u
+mail_home = /home/vmail/%{user|domain}/%{user|username} # or some variant of this.
```

```diff
-mail_location = maildir:~/
+mail_path = ~/
+mail_driver = maildir
```

```diff
-mail_location = maildir:/var/srv/foo/%d/%u
+mail_path = /var/srv/foo/%{user|domain}/%{user|username}
+mail_driver = maildir
```

In addition you might want to convert:

```diff
-INDEX=~/.index
+mail_index_path=~/.index
```

```diff
-CONTROL=~/.control
+mail_control_path=~/.control
```

```diff
-LAYOUT=fs
+mailbox_list_layout=fs
```

A minimal working config is:

```
mail_home=/home/vmail/%{user}
mail_driver=maildir
mail_path=~/maildir
mail_uid=vmail
mail_gid=vmail
```

#### Namespace

```diff
 namespace other {
-  location = maildir:/foo/bar
+  mail_path = /foo/bar
+  # optional, if this is matches your top level
+  mail_driver = maildir
 }
```
