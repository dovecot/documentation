| Feature | Notes |
| ------- | ----- |
| fts-lucene, fts-squat | Use [[plugin,fts-flatcurve]] or [[plugin,fts-solr]]. |
| dsync: Remove -D parameter | Parameter for disabling mailbox rename syncing removed. It hasn't been necessary for a long time, and it is broken. |

| director | Support for the Dovecot Director architecture has been removed. For a small-scale, unsupported replacement, see [[link,lua_director]]. |
| replicator | Use [[link,nfs]] or some other shared filesystem instead. |
