# Upgrading Dovecot CE from 2.2 to 2.3

::: warning
Downgrading is possible to v2.2.27 and later. (v2.2.27 accidentally broke
`dovecot.index*` backwards compatibility a bit.)
:::

## Dovecot CE

### Settings Changes

* `mdbox_purge_preserve_alt` setting removed. It's always assumed to be
  "yes" now.

### Changed Setting Defaults

| Setting | Old Default Value | New Default Value |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [[setting,mdbox_rotate_size]] | 2M | 10M |
