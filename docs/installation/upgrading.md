# Upgrading Dovecot

The [NEWS](https://github.com/dovecot/core/blob/main/NEWS) file, contained in
the top-level of the source, contains all the important changes between
releases. These changes are marked with `*` character.

Read them to see if there is anything that concerns you.

In general all the changes try to preserve backwards compatibility, but some
changes which are meant to improve the stability and correctness of the
configuration could mean breaking some existing installations. That may be a
good thing, since it can expose problems which could otherwise show up as
random errors.

## Dovecot CE 2.3 and later

See the "Upgrading Docs" directory.

## Dovecot CE (2.2 and earlier)

See https://doc.dovecot.org/installation_guide/upgrading/.
