# Migrating Mailboxes

::: warning
Badly done migration will cause your IMAP and/or POP3 clients to re-download
all mails! Read this page carefully!
:::

This guide assumes that the target host has a v2.3 or newer version of Dovecot.

You should use migration when you are changing Dovecot storage configuration,
such as compression, encryption or mail location driver; or want to
restructure your mails in some way.

Things that you should consider in your config:

* [[link,mail_location]]
* IMAP client settings (when needed)
* [[link,namespaces,Namespace definitions including public and shared
  namespaces]]
* [[plugin,acl,ACL settings]]
* [[plugin,quota]]: Quota without rules (to make sure quota gets calculated,
  but not enforced)
* [[link,mail_cache]]
* [[setting,mail_attachment_detection_options]]
* [[setting,mail_attribute]]
* [[plugin,mail-compress]] and [[plugin,mail-crypt]] settings
* [[link,nfs]] related settings

Sometimes, if your production configuration file has complex authentication
flows, push notifications, or other settings that might cause unwanted
effects during migration, you can make a separate migration configuration
file. To use this configuration file, you can store it as, for example,
`/etc/dovecot/dovecot-migration.conf`, and use it with
`doveadm -c /etc/dovecot/dovecot-migration.conf sync`.

Other settings to use:

* [[setting,dsync_features,empty-header-workaround]]

  * This is sometimes needed with some broken servers.

* [[setting,mail_prefetch_count,20]]

  * Read multiple mails in parallel; improves performance.

* [[setting,dsync_commit_msgs_interval,100]]

  * If you have very large mailboxes, you might want to tune this

* [[setting,dsync_hashed_headers,Date Message-ID]]

  * If you need to hash other headers for whatever reason, you can change this

* [[setting,mail_fsync,never]]

  * Avoid useless I/O.

## Testing

It is a very good idea to do some test migrations first using test accounts
to ensure everything works.

When migrating mails from another server, you should make sure that these
are preserved:

1. Message flags

   * Lost flags can be really annoying, you most likely want to avoid it.

2. Message UIDs and UIDVALIDITY value

   * If UIDs are lost, at a minimum clients' message cache gets cleaned
     and messages are re-downloaded as new.
   * Some IMAP clients store metadata by assigning it to specific UID,
     if UIDs are changed these will be lost.

3. Mailbox subscription list

## Migrating Mailboxes from Another Dovecot Server

### Preparations

If the old system is running v2.1.14+ , you can use doveadm protocol to
migrate your mails.

If the old system is older, see
[migrating messages over IMAP](#migrating-messages-over-imap).

First, setup doveadm service on old server:

```[dovecot.conf]
service doveadm {
  inet_listener {
    port = 12354
  }
}

doveadm_password = supersecret
```

Then set doveadm password on new server:

```
doveadm_password = supersecret
```

Now you are ready to migrate.

### Executing Migration

If you want to avoid any changes to your source system, unidirectional
synchronization is recommended.

To migrate users, use: [[doveadm,backup,-Ru username tcp:host:port]].

If you are experiencing problems, run:

```sh
doveadm -D backup -Ru username tcp:host:port
```

This will enable debug logging.

The doveadm backup command forces the destination to look exactly like
the source, deleting mails and mailboxes if necessary.

If it's possible that the destination already has new mails (or other
changes), use [[doveadm,sync,-1]] instead:

```sh
doveadm -o imapc_password=bar sync -1Ru user imapc:
```

You can run the command again to perform incremental updates.

Note that Public and Shared namespaces are synchronized automatically
(see caveats).

#### Caveats

* Migrating shared namespaces is difficult prior to v2.3.15+. To migrate
  Shared namespaces, you need to use `-n Shared -n Shared/Mailbox`.
* If you are using ACLs, some ACL types can cause problems. Especially if
  you have ACLs that only permit writing to folder, but not reading it.
  This applies to shared folders only.
* Migration can cause unexpectedly high loads on the source system. Beware!
  There is no way to throttle the synchronization.
* Avoid accessing the target mailboxes before the first sync. At best this
  causes warnings about GUID or UIDVALIDITY changes, and at worst it fails
  the sync entirely.

## Migrating mailboxes over IMAP

When migrating mails over IMAP, you need to have valid credentials to the
source system.

You can either use master password, master user, or individual user
authentication.

This depends entirely on the source system. See [[link,auth_master_users]]
for more details.

### Preparations

Configure authentication on the source system to match your preference.
Ensure both source and target system agree on usernames.

Configure IMAP client on the target system.

::: tip [[changed,migration_imapc_features]]
Some selected IMAPC features are auto-enabled by default. Please refer
to [[setting,imapc_features]] for description on individual flags.
:::

Common settings:

* [[setting,imapc_features,rfc822.size fetch-headers]]

  * These are supported by standard adhering servers.

* [[setting,imapc_list_prefix,INBOX]]

  * If the old IMAP server uses `INBOX.` namespace prefix, set this.

* [[setting,imapc_host,remotehost]]

  * Remote hostname.

* [[setting,imapc_ssl,imaps]] and [[setting,imapc_port,993]]

  * Set, if using TLS.

* [[setting,imapc_ssl,starttls]] and [[setting,imapc_port,143]]

  * Set, if using STARTTLS.

* [[setting,ssl_client_ca_dir,/etc/ssl/certs]] or
  [[setting,ssl_client_ca_file,/etc/ssl/ca-certificates.pem]]

  * These default to system.

Master password auth:

```
imapc_user = %u
imapc_password = supersecret
```

Master user auth:

```
imapc_user = %u
imapc_master_user = master-user
imapc_password = master-password
```

Individual password auth:

```
imapc_user = %u

# doveadm -o imapc_password=password backup -Ru user imapc:
```

You can verify that the settings are done correctly with:

```sh
doveadm -o imapc_password=password -o mail_location=imapc: mailbox list -u user
```

### POP3 notes

If you need to retain POP3 support on your new system, you should use
[[plugin,pop3-migration]].

```[dovecot.conf]
pop3c_host = hostname

# Authenticate as masteruser / masteruser-secret, but use a separate login
# user.
# If you don't have a master user, remove the pop3c_master_user setting.
pop3c_user = %u
pop3c_master_user = masteruser
pop3c_password = masteruser-secret

# if you are using TLS
pop3c_ssl = pop3s
pop3c_port = 995

# if you are using StartTLS
pop3c_ssl = starttls
pop3c_port = 110

namespace {
  prefix = POP3-MIGRATION-NS/
  location = pop3c:
  list = no
  hidden = yes
}

protocol doveadm {
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins pop3_migration
}

plugin {
  pop3_migration_mailbox = POP3-MIGRATION-NS/INBOX
}
```

You can alternatively configure compatible UIDL format in Dovecot. See
[[setting,pop3_uidl_format]].

### Executing Migration

To migrate users, use:

```sh
doveadm -o imapc_password=bar -o pop3c_password=bar backup -Ru user imapc:
```

If you are experiencing problems, enable debugging with the `-D` parameter:

```sh
doveadm -D -o imapc_password=bar -o pop3c_password=bar backup -Ru username imapc:
```

The doveadm backup command forces the destination to look exactly like the
source, deleting mails and mailboxes if necessary.

If it's possible that the destination already has new mails (or other changes), use [[doveadm,sync,-1]] instead:

```sh
doveadm -o imapc_password=bar -o pop3c_password=bar sync -1Ru user imapc:
```

Note that Public and Shared namespaces are synchronized automatically
(see caveats).

See [[link,doveadm_error_codes]] for details on how to handle errors.

#### Caveats

* You cannot migrate **to** imap, only from.

#### POP3 Caveats

* POP3 message order (when it's different from IMAP message order) is not
  preserved with [[link,mbox]].
* If source POP3 server merges multiple IMAP mailboxes into one POP3 INBOX,
  the migration won't be transparent.
* If source IMAP and POP3 servers return messages somehow differently,
  [[plugin,pop3-migration]] might not be able to match the messages
* Don't trust the migration tools blindly. Verify manually that the UIDLs
  are correct before exposing real clients to Dovecot.

  You can do this by logging in using your old POP3 server, issuing UIDL
  command and saving the output.

  Then log in using Dovecot and save its UIDL output as well. Use e.g. `diff`
  command to verify that the lists are identical. Note that:

  * If a client already saw changed UIDLs and decided to start
    re-downloading mails, it's unlikely there is anything you can do to
    stop it. Even going back to your old server is unlikely to help at
    that point.
  * Some (many?) POP3 clients also require that the message ordering is
    preserved.
  * Some clients re-download all mails if you change the hostname in
    the client configuration. Be aware of this when testing.

## Migration from Gmail to Dovecot

You can use dsync migration via IMAP protocol, but there are a few things
different with Gmail compared to other IMAP servers.

With Gmail, when you delete a mail from POP3, the mail is only hidden from
future POP3 sessions, but it's still available via IMAP.
If you wish to preserve this functionality, there's a
[[setting,pop3_deleted_flag]] setting.

Gmail has labels. If a message has multiple labels, it shows up in multiple
IMAP folders, but it's still the same message and uses quota only once
for that message. Dovecot currently doesn't have label support, so the
migration will copy the message to multiple folders and each instance will
use up quota. There's currently no easy fix for this.

Even though the quota is duplicated, it doesn't mean that the storage
usage has to be duplicated. Use the doveadm sync's `-a` parameter to attempt
to copy mails with the same GUIDs.

A virtual `All Mails` mailbox needs to be configured using the virtual
plugin. Then you need to give this mailbox as `-a` parameter, e.g.:

```
doveadm sync -a "Virtual/All Mails" ...
```

Currently this is implemented by reading through all the GUIDs in the
virtual mailbox. This of course isn't very efficient for things like
incremental replication.

Gmail has virtual folders: `All Mail`, `Starred` and `Important`. From
migration point of view, this means that the migration should skip most
of these folders, since their mails are in other folders anyway.
You can tell dsync to skip these folders:

```
doveadm sync -x '\Flagged' -x '\Important'
```

By using the `\flag` parameters, dsync finds the folders by their
`SPECIAL-USE` flag rather than their name (which may be different for users
depending on their language).

The `All Mail` folder contains also "archived mails" that don't exist in
any other folder. These mails need to be migrated. See below.

Google requires that SSL/TLS be enabled to connect through IMAP. See
[migrating messages over IMAP](#migrating-messages-over-imap) for information
on the various SSL/TLS related flags.

Google has very limited support for username/password authentication, so you
might have to use OAUTH2 or some other mechanism for logging in.

### GMail Migration Feature

There is a [[setting,imapc_features,gmail-migration]] setting that helps
with GMail migration. It will:

* Set the [[setting,pop3_deleted_flag]] to mails that no longer exist in POP3.
* Return POP3 UIDL in GMail format so dsync can preserve it.
* Add a new `$GmailHaveLabels` keyword to archived mails in the `\All`
  mailbox, which means those mails are not archived. You probably don't want
  to migrate these mails.

  * Note that mails in the `\Important` and `\Flagged` mailboxes are marked
    with `\Important` and `\Starred` labels. If you don't migrate mails that
    have `$GmailHaveLabels` then you must not exclude the `\Flagged` and
    `\Important` mailboxes or some of the mails won't be migrated.

    For example use a command line:

    ```sh
    doveadm backup -a 'virtual/All' -O '-$GmailHaveLabels' -R -u user@domain imapc:
    ```
