# doveadm-search-query(7) - Overview of search queries for doveadm mailbox commands

## DESCRIPTION

Several [[man,doveadm]] commands use a *search_query* in order to act
only on matching messages. This manual page describes all *SEARCH KEYS*,
which can be used in a *search_query*. The query is mostly compatible
with the IMAP SEARCH command parameters, although there are some
differences.

Each *search_query* consists at least of one *SEARCH KEY*. Most of the
*SEARCH KEYS* require an argument. All *SEARCH KEYS* are
case-insensitive. The shortest valid *search_query* is **ALL**. For
example:

```console
$ doveadm search ALL
```

Multiple search query expressions will be combined with the **AND**
operator by default. To find all messages that are new and greater than
50 kilobyte, one can use:

```console
$ doveadm search NEW LARGER 50k
```

**OR**-ed *SEARCH KEYS* have to be written in parenthesis, when mixing
ANDs and ORs. Shells commonly require escaping for parentheses. To find
messages that were saved on the "13th of April 2007" AND have the \\Seen
and/or \\Flagged flag set, one can use for example:

```console
$ doveadm search SAVEDON 2007-04-13 \( SEEN OR FLAGGED \)
```

It's also possible to specify the mailbox, in which should be searched.
Use either the keyword **mailbox** and the name of the mailbox or the
keyword **mailbox-guid** and the mailbox's globally unique identifier in
the *search_query*. To find all messages in the mailbox with the GUID
"44f68b13ce97044b837f000035ca9452" use:

```console
$ doveadm search mailbox-guid 44f68b13ce97044b837f000035ca9452 ALL
```

To list all deleted messages in the "Trash" folder use:

```console
$ doveadm search mailbox Trash DELETED
```

## SEARCH KEYS

The following search keys from the specification of IMAP version 4
revision 1 (see: [[rfc,3501,6.4.4]]) are supported:

*sequence-set*
:   Matches messages with the given sequence numbers. The
    *sequence-set* may be a single UID. Can be a sequence range,
    written as *from*:*to*, e.g. **100**:**125**. As comma separated
    list of sequences, e.g. **11,50,4**. It's also possible to combine
    multiple sequences, e.g. **1,3,5,7,10:20**. Using ***** selects
    the last mail in the mailbox.

    For example 1:100 matches the first 100 mails and 101:200 the next
    second hundred mails. 1,5,* matches the first, the fifth and the
    last email.

**ALL**
:   Matches all messages.

**ANSWERED**
:   Matches messages with the IMAP flag \\Answered set.
