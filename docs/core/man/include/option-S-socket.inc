**-S** *socket_path*
:   The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
    domain socket, or a hostname and port (*hostname*:*port*), in order
    to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

    This allows an administrator to execute [[man,doveadm]]
    mail commands through the given socket.
