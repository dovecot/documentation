**-A**
:   If the **-A** option is present, the *command* will be performed for
    all users. Using this option in combination with system users from
    **userdb { driver = passwd }** is not recommended, because it
    contains also users with a lower UID than the one configured with the
    `first_valid_uid` setting.

	When the SQL userdb module is used, make sure that the
	[[setting,userdb_sql_iterate_query]] setting matches your database layout.
	When using the LDAP userdb module, make sure that the *iterate_attrs* and
	*iterate_filter* settings in */etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext* match
	your LDAP schema. Otherwise [[man,doveadm]] will be unable to iterate over
	all users.
