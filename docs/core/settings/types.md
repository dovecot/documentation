# Dovecot Settings Types

## String

String can contain any character. Strings support [[variable]].

::: tip
If you need the `%` character verbatim you have to escape it as `%%`.
:::

## String without variables

Certain settings require specific variables and thus don't use the default
[[variable]]. For example:

```[dovecot.conf]
imap_logout_format = in=%i out=%o
```

Here the `%i` and `%o` refer to variables specific to the
[[setting,imap_logout_format]] setting.

## Unsigned Integer

Unsigned integer is a number between `0`..`4294967295`, although specific
settings may have additional restrictions.

The value can also be `unlimited`, which translates to `4294967295`.

## Octal Unsigned Integer

Same as [[link,settings_types_uint]], but if the value is prefixed with `0`,
the number is read as octal (instead of decimal).

## Boolean

Boolean settings interpret any value as true, or false.

`yes` and `no` are the recommended values. However, `y` and `1` also
work as `yes`. Whereas, only `no` will work as false.

All these are case-insensitive. Other values give errors.

## Size

The size value type is used in Dovecot configuration to define the amount of
space taken by something, such as a file, cache or memory limit. The size value
type is case insensitive. The following suffixes can be used to define size:

| Suffix | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| `B` | bytes |
| `K` | kilobytes |
| `M` | megabytes |
| `G` | gigabytes |
| `T` | terabytes |

The values can optionally be followed by `I` or `IB`. For example
`K = KI = KIB`. The size value type is base `2`, meaning a kilobyte equals
`1024` bytes.

The value can also be `unlimited`.

## Time

The Time value is used in Dovecot configuration to define the amount of Time
taken by something or for doing something, such as a sending or downloading
file, processing, and more.

The Time value supports using suffixes of any of the following words:

 * `secs`
 * `seconds`
 * `mins`
 * `minutes`
 * `hours`
 * `days`
 * `weeks`

::: info
So for example, `d`, `da`, `day`, and `days` all mean the same. Make sure to be
explicit if you want to differentiate between `mins` and `msecs`, as `m` does
not suffice.
:::

The value can also be `infinite`.

## Millisecond Time

This is similar to [Time](#time), but additionally supports milliseconds
(`ms`) precision.

The Millisecond Time value supports using suffixes of any of the
following words:

 * All the suffixes supported by [Time](#time)
 * `msecs`
 * `mseconds`
 * `millisecs`
 * `milliseconds`

All of these have the same meaning. Similarly to [Time](#time), the suffixes
can be shortened to e.g. `ms`.

## IP Addresses

The IP can be IPv4 address like `127.0.0.1`, IPv6 address without brackets
like `::1`, or with brackets like `[::1]`. The DNS name is looked up once
during config parsing, e.g. `host.example.com`. If a /block is specified,
then it's a CIDR address like `1.2.3.0/24`. If a /block isn't specified, then
it defaults to all bits, i.e. /32 for IPv4 addresses and /128 for IPv6
addresses.

## Port Number

This type is an [[link,settings_types_uint]] with numbers ranging only from `0`
to `65535`.

## URL

Special type of [String](#string) setting. Conforms to Uniform Resource
Locators (URL) ([[rfc,1738]]).

## File

Path to a file. The file contents are read already by the config process, so
the file permissions don't usually matter. However, some callers need to open
the file again (e.g. the `ssl_client_cert_file` setting with MySQL) after
the process has dropped root privileges.

The file paths do not support [[link,settings_variables,%variables]].

It's possible to give inline values (instead of a path to a file) for the
setting by using `inline:` prefix in the value. For example userdb could be
returning `crypt_global_public_key_file=inline:<public key content>` without
having to use files.

## Named Filter

The settings inside the filter are used only in a specific situation. See
[[link,settings_syntax_named_filters]] for more details.

## Named List Filter

The settings inside the filter are used only in a specific situation. The
filter has a unique name, which can be used to identify it within the list.
See [[link,settings_syntax_named_filters]] for more details.

## String List

The string list type is a list of `key=value` pairs. Each key name is unique
within the list (i.e. giving the same key multiple times overrides the previous
one). The string list is configured similarly to
[[link,settings_syntax_named_filters]]:

```[dovecot.conf]
fs_randomfail_ops {
  read = 100
  write = 50
}
```

## Boolean List

The boolean list type is a list of `key=yes/no` pairs. Each key is unique
within the list (i.e. giving the same key multiple times overrides the previous
one). The boolean list can be configured as a space or comma-separated list,
which replaces the previous boolean  list entirely. For example:

```[dovecot.conf]
mail_plugins = quota imap_quota
mail_plugins = acl,imap_acl # removes quota and imap_quota
```

Quotes are also supported:

```[dovecot.conf]
doveadm_allowed_commands = "mailbox list" "mailbox create"
```

The boolean list can also be configured to update an existing boolean list. For
example:

```[dovecot.conf]
mail_plugins = quota acl
protocol imap {
  mail_plugins {
    imap_quota = yes
    imap_acl = yes
  }
}
local 10.0.0.0/24 {
  protocol imap {
    mail_plugins {
      imap_acl = no
    }
  }
}
```
