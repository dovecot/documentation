# Settings Variables

You can use special variables in several places:

* All settings, except of type [[link,settings_types_string_novar]]. Most
  commonly used by [[link,mail_location]].
* Static [[link,userdb]] and [[link,auth_passwd_file]] template strings
* [[link,auth_ldap]], [[link,auth_sql]], and [[link,userdb]] query strings
* Log prefix for imap/pop3 process

## Global Variables

Global variables that work everywhere are:

| Long Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `%%` | '%' character. [[link,shared_mailboxes_percent,Further information about %% variables]] |
| `env:<name>` | Environment variable \<name\>. |
| `system:<name>` | Get a system variable, see [below](#system-variables) for list of supported names. |
| `process:<name>` | Get a process variable, see [below](#process-variables) for list of supported names. |
| `dovecot:<name>` | Get a distribution variable, see [below](#distribution-variables) for a list of supported names.

If [[plugin,var-expand-crypt]] is loaded, these also work globally:

| Long Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `encrypt; <parameters>:<field>` | Encrypt field |
| `decrypt; <parameters>:<field>` | Decrypt field |

## System Variables

### `cpu_count`

Number of CPUs available. Works only on Linux and FreeBSD-like systems.

Can be overridden with `NCPU` environment variable.

This needs to be included in [[setting,import_environment]].

### `hostname`

Hostname (without domain). Can be overridden with `DOVECOT_HOSTNAME`
environment variable.

This needs to be included in [[setting,import_environment]].

### `os`

OS name reported by `uname()` call. (Similar to `uname -s` output.)

### `os-version`

OS version reported by `uname()` call. (Similar to `uname -r` output.)

## Process Variables

### `pid`

Current process ID.

### `uid`

Effective user ID of the current process.

### `gid`

Effective group ID of the current process.

## Distribution Variables

### `name`

Name of distributed package. (Default: `Dovecot`)

### `version`

Dovecot version.

### `support-url`

Support webpage set in Dovecot distribution. (Default:
https://www.dovecot.org/)

### `support-email`

Support email set in Dovecot distribution. (Default: `dovecot@dovecot.org`)

### `revision`

Short commit hash of Dovecot git source tree HEAD. (Same as the commit hash
reported in `dovecot --version`.)

## User Variables

Variables that work nearly everywhere where there is a username:

| Variable | Long Name | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |

| | `session` | session ID for this client connection (unique for 9 years) |
| | `auth_user` | SASL authentication ID (e.g. if master user login is done, this contains the master username). If username changes during authentication, this value contains the original username. Otherwise the same as `%{user}`. |
| | `auth_username` | user part in `%{auth_user}` |

## Modifiers

You can apply a modifies for each variable (e.g. `%Us` or `%U{service}` = POP3):

* `%L` - lowercase
* `%U` - uppercase
* `%E` - escape '"', "'" and '\\' characters by inserting '\\' before them.
  Note that variables in SQL queries are automatically escaped, you don't need
  to use this modifier for them.
* `%X` - parse the variable as a base-10 number, and convert it to base-16
  (hexadecimal)
* `%R` - reverse the string
* `%N` - take a 32bit hash of the variable and return it as hex. You can also
  limit the hash value. For example `%256Nu` gives values 0..ff. You might want
  padding also, so `%2.256Nu` gives 00..ff.

  * This is "New Hash", based on MD5 to give better distribution of values (no
    need for any string reversing kludges either).

* `%H` - Same as `%N`, but use "old hash" (not recommended anymore)

  * `%H` hash function is a bit bad if all the strings end with the same text,
    so if you're hashing usernames being in user@domain form, you probably
	want to reverse the username to get better hash value variety, e.g.
	`%3RHu`.

* `%{<hash algorithm>;rounds=<n>,truncate=<bits>,salt=s,format=<hex|hexuc|base64|base64url>:field}`

  * Generic hash function that outputs a hex (by default) or `base64` value.
    Hash algorithm is any of the supported ones, e.g. `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`.
    Also "pkcs5" is supported using `SHA256`.

    Example:

    ```
    %{sha256:user} or %{md5;truncate=32:user}.
	```

* `%M` - return the string's MD5 sum as hex.
* `%D` - return "sub.domain.org" as "sub,dc=domain,dc=org" (for LDAP queries)
* `%T` - Trim trailing whitespace

You can take a substring of the variable by giving optional offset followed by
'.' and width after the '%' character. For example `%2u` gives first two
characters of the username. `%2.1u` gives third character of the username.

If the offset is negative, it counts from the end, for example `%-2.2i` gives
the UID mod 100 (last two characters of the UID printed in a string). If a
positive offset points outside the value, empty string is returned, if a
negative offset does then the string is taken from the start.

If the width is prefixed with zero, the string isn't truncated, but only padded
with '0' character if the string is shorter.

::: warning
`%04i` may return "0001", "1000" and "12345". `%1.04i` for the same string
would return "001", "000" and "2345".
:::

If the width is negative, it counts from the end.

::: warning
`%0.-2u` gives all but the last two characters from the username.
:::

The modifiers are applied from left-to-right order, except the substring is
always taken from the final string.

## Conditionals

It's possible to use conditionals in variable expansion. The generic syntax is

```
%{if;value1;operator;value2;value-if-true;value-if-false}
```

Each of the value fields can contain another variable expansion, facilitating
for nested ifs. Both `%f` and `%{field}` syntaxes work.

Escaping is supported, so it's possible to use values like `\%`, `\:` or `\;`
that expand to the literal `%`, `:` or `;` characters. Values can have spaces
and quotes without any special escaping.

Note that currently unescaped `:` cuts off the if statement and ignores
everything after it.

The following operators are supported:

| Operator | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `==` | NUMERIC equality |
| `!=` | NUMERIC inequality |
| `<` | NUMERIC less than |
| `<=` | NUMERIC less or equal |
| `>` | NUMERIC greater than |
| `>=` | NUMERIC greater or equal |
| `eq` | String equality |
| `ne` | String inequality |
| `lt` | String inequality |
| `le` | String inequality |
| `gt` | String inequality |
| `ge` | String inequality |
| `*` | Wildcard match (mask on value2) |
| `!*` | Wildcard non-match (mask on value2) |
| `~` | Regular expression match (pattern on value2, extended POSIX) |
| `!~` | String inequality (pattern on value2, extended POSIX) |

Examples:

```
# If %u is "testuser", return "INVALID". Otherwise return %u uppercased.
%{if;%u;eq;testuser;INVALID;%Uu}

# Same as above, but for use nested IF just for showing how they work:
%{if;%{if;%u;eq;testuser;a;b};eq;a;INVALID;%Uu}
```
