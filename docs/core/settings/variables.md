# Settings Variables

You can use special variables in several places:

* All settings, except of type [[link,settings_types_string_novar]]. Most
  commonly used by [[link,mail_location]].
* Static [[link,userdb]] and [[link,auth_passwd_file]] template strings
* [[link,auth_ldap]], [[link,auth_sql]], and [[link,userdb]] query strings
* Log prefix for imap/pop3 process

## Variable expansion syntax

[[changed,var_expand]]

We have introduced an entirely new variable expansion syntax.
See [[link,var_expand]] for in-depth details how it works.

The basic syntax is `%{variable (| filter | filter ...)}`, which means that most existing
variables work, but there are some changes, so check variable usage carefully when converting old syntax.

The simple case of just getting a value of variable is `%{variable}`.
These can be in middle of strings.

Another syntax is `%{provider:variable}`, where the value is provided by
a provider. There are global providers, and context-specific providers.

A variable can be then filtered with various filters, such as `%{variable | upper}` to get
uppercase representation of variable. You can chain as many filters as you need.

Filters can accept parameters, both positional and named. E.g. `%{literal('\r\n\')}` will expand
to CR LF. `%{user | substr(0, 1)}` will take first character of username. Example of named parameters
would be `%{user | md5(rounds=1000,salt='pepper')}`

For escaping:
 * `%%{text}` emits `%{text}`
 * `%%%{text}` emits `%%{text}`
 * `%{concat('%', variable)}` emits `%<expanded variable>`
 * Otherwise `%` doesn't need any escaping. `%%` emits the same `%%`.

Filters accept strings, numbers and variables as parameters. Parameters can be positional or
named key-value pairs. Key names cannot be variables.
The left side of pipe character (`|`) is provided as input to a filter. Some filters can be used
in place of variables, e.g. lookup, literal and if.

When value is missing or empty, you can use the `default` filter to provide value. Missing variables
will cause errors and must be negated with default. This does not apply to all providers, some
providers return empty when value is missing.

If the last filter would output binary data, the data is encoded with `hexlify` filter by default.
To avoid this, you can use `text` filter, which will sanitize the input and mark it as text.

The new syntax also supports simple maths, you can do one operation. E.g. `%{port + 1000}`.
Addition, substraction, multiplication, division and modulo operations are supported for now.

A special case for modulo operation is that it can be applied to binary input, e.g. `sha1 % 256`.
The input is treated as 64-bit unsigned number and modulo is taken from that.

All strings must be encapsulated with `"` or `'`, and you can escape them using `\\` within string.
Numbers when used as parameters must be provided without quotes.

## List of filters

All parameters are strings unless stated otherwise.
If parameter is `any`, it accepts both numbers and strings.
Boolean type is `0` for false and `1` for true.

Filters that have `any` in input and output mean that they will accept bytes or string, and the result
will be bytes or strings, depending on the input. The types indicated as interpreted types, as everything
is stored as strings internally.

Bytes output type indicates that the output will be tagged as binary output. Subsequent filters can change this.

| Filter | Input | Output | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| base64(pad=boolean, url=boolean) | Bytes | String | Base64 encode given input, defaults to pad and not url scheme. |

| decrypt(key=string,salt=string,rounds=number,raw=boolean,hash=string,algorithm=string) | Any | Any | Decrypts given input, see [cryptography support](#cryptography-support). |
| default(value) | String | String | Replace empty or missing input with value. Clears missing variable error. If no value is provided, empty string is used. |

| if(left,operator,right,true,false) | String | String | Evaluates given comparison and returns true or false value. See [conditionals](#conditionals). |
| if(operator,right,true,false) | String | String | Evaluates given comparison against input value and retuns true or false value. |
| index(separator, nth) | String | String | Returns nth element from separator separated string. Zero based. Negative values are looked relative to end of list. |

| literal(string) | None | String | Expands into literally the value. If variable is used, works like lookup. Input is ignored. |
| lookup(name) | None | String | Lookup var from table. If var is variable, the name is taken from variable's contents. Input is ignored. |
| lower | String | String | Lowercases input. |

If length is omitted, returns everything through the end of the string. If length is negative, leaves that many characters off the end of the string. |
| text | Bytes | String | Sanitize input into text and clear binary tag. |
| truncate(len, bits=number) | Bytes | Bytes | Truncate to len bytes, or number of bits. The parameters are mutually exclusive. |

## Cryptography support

### Parameters

| Key                | Value                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| key                | The encryption key.                                                             |
| iv                 | Initialization vector.                                                          |
| salt               | Salt to use in PBKDF2 algorithm.                                                |
| hash               | Hash to use in PBKDF2. Defaults to `sha256`.                                    |
| rounds             | Number of rounds to use in PBKDF2. Defaults to 10 000.                          |
| algorithm          | Encryption algorithm. Expects OpenSSL naming. Defaults to `aes-256-cbc`.        |
| raw                | When set to 1, will return encrypted result in raw output format. Default is 0. |

### Key, initialization vector and salt.

For legacy reasons, this function supports direct keying and salted keying.
In direct keying, the `key` and `iv` must be provided hex encoded, and must match the algorithm's requirements.

If `key` and `salt` are provided, then the actual encryption key and initialization vector are generated with [PBKDF2 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

If only `key` is provided a random salt is generated. Random salt cannot be generated in raw mode, because it would not get stored,
so it must be always provided.

### Structured output format

Dovecot supports structured encrypted data.
If initialization vector is directly provided, the output syntax is `iv$data$`.
With salt based keying material generation, the format is `s=salt,r=rounds$data$`.

### Raw output format

If raw is used, the raw encryption result is emitted with no salt, rounds or IV included.

### Recommended usage

For best results, you should leave salt and IV management to Dovecot.

### Examples

```[dovecot.conf]
import_environment = {
   SECRET_KEY = %{env:SECRET_KEY}
}
imapc_password = "%{literal('s=3-?I&-a|,r=10000$e80e6ab3c18c0da69b20bf201eaf6269$') | decrypt(key=env:SECRET_KEY)}"
```

Stores imap client password securely so that it can be decrypted only if `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is provided.

To easily generate an encrypted value, you can use [[doveadm,user,user -e "%{literal('value') | encrypt(key='secret')}"]].
