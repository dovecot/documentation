# Listescape Plugin (`listescape`)

The listescape plugin allows users to use characters in mailboxes names that
would otherwise be illegal (due to the underlying mailbox storage).

For example:

* Maildir++ layout disallows using the `.` character, since it's used
  internally as the folder hierarchy separator.
* The `~` character at the beginning of the mailbox name is disallowed,
  because of the possibility that it gets expanded to user's home directory.
* The `/` character is disallowed on POSIX systems.

This plugin allows you to use all of these characters, as long as the virtual
separator (i.e. what is set by the [[setting,namespace_separator]] setting
and used as such by the IMAP protocol) is changed to something else, which
means that the plugin does **not** make it possible to use the virtual
separator in folder names.

The characters are escaped to the mailbox name as `\NN` hex codes.

## Good Hierarchy Separators

* `.` and `/` are very commonly used and should work everywhere
* `\` is used by Exchange, and should also work everywhere (when specifying
  this in the [[setting,listescape_char]] setting it must be quoted, so one
  sets [[setting,listescape_char,"\\"]])
* `^` is used internally by Thunderbird and causes some trouble with it

## Settings

<SettingsComponent plugin="listescape" />

## Sample Configuration

Allow `.` characters with Maildir++ layout when virtual hierarchy separator
is changed to `/` (it could be anything else except `.` itself):

```[dovecot.conf]
mail_plugins = $mail_plugins listescape

namespace private {
  separator = /
  inbox = yes
}

plugin {
  listescape_char = "\\"
}
```
