# Sieve IMAPSieve Plugin (`sieve-imapsieve`)

IMAPSieve ([[rfc,6785]]) defines the use of Sieve
filtering in IMAP, operating when messages are created or their
attributes are changed.

The `sieve_imapsieve` plugin implements the `imapsieve` extension
for the Sieve filtering language, adding functionality for using Sieve
scripts from within IMAP.
