# Login Processes

<!-- @include: include/login_process_overview.inc -->

The default login settings should be good enough for small sites. There are two
ways to run the login processes: the high-security mode and the
high-performance mode. Both are discussed separately below.

For explanation on the various settings for services, see
[[link,service_configuration]].

## High-Security Mode (default)

<!-- @include: include/login_process_high_security.inc -->

## High-Performance Mode

<!-- @include: include/login_process_high_performance.inc -->

<!-- @include: include/login_process_socket_paths.inc -->
