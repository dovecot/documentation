## Common Delivery Settings

* [[setting,postmaster_address]] is used as the From: header address in
  bounce mails

* [[setting,hostname]] is used in generated Message-IDs and in
  `Reporting-UA:` header in bounce mails

* [[setting,sendmail_path]] is used to send mails. Note that the default is
  `/usr/sbin/sendmail`, which doesn't necessarily work the same as
  `/usr/lib/sendmail`.

  * Alternatively you can use [[setting,submission_host]] to send mails via
    the specified SMTP server.

* [[setting,auth_socket_path]] specifies the UNIX socket to auth-userdb
  where LDA can lookup userdb information when `-d` parameter is used.
  See below how to configure Dovecot to configure the socket.

::: tip Note
The config files must be world readable to enable dovecot-lda process to read
them while running with user privileges.

You can put password related settings to a separate file, which you
include with \`!include_try\` and dovecot-lda skips them.
