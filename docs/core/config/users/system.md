# System Users

System users are typically defined in `/etc/passwd` file, but this
isn't necessary. Using [NSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch)
you can configure the lookups to be done from elsewhere (e.g. LDAP).

See [[link,auth_passwd]] userdb configuration for how to set this up.
Especially if you're using nss_ldap you must set `blocking=yes`.

System users usually have their own separate user IDs (UIDs). This is
good from a security point of view, because it means that the kernel will
also prevent users from accessing each others' mails.

If the users have direct write access to the mail files (eg. the users
have shell access), they can easily cause all sorts of mailbox
corruptions. That may generate all kinds of error messages to Dovecot's
error logs, so it may be sometimes difficult to tell if there really is
a problem or if the user is doing something stupid.

If users are going to access the mailboxes with other software than
Dovecot, it's important to make sure that their mailbox accesses are
compatible. This mostly means that with [[link,mbox]]you must make sure that
everyone uses the same locking methods in the same order.

## Authentication

Admins often wish to use different passwords for IMAP and POP3 than for
other services (eg. SSH), because IMAP and POP3 clients often send the
password unencrypted over the internet without even bothering to give
users any warnings. Dovecot can easily support non-system passwords for
system users.

If you wish to use system passwords, you'll want to use one of these
passdbs:

- [[link,auth_pam]]: Most commonly used in Linux and BSDs nowadays.

- [[link,auth_bsd]]: BSD authentication is used by OpenBSD.

- [[link,auth_passwd]]: System users (NSS, `/etc/passwd`, or similar).
  This may work instead of PAM (mostly in some BSDs).

If you wish to use non-system passwords, you can use pretty much any
[[link,passdb]], but for simple installations you'll probably want to use
[[link,auth_passwd_file]].

[[link,userdb]] for system users is always [[link,auth_passwd]].

## Mail Location

Usually UNIX systems are configured by default to deliver mails to
`/var/mail/username` or `/var/spool/mail/username` mboxes. You may
decide to use these, or use newer mailbox formats instead, such as
[[link,maildir]] or [[link,dbox]].

Dovecot detects the mailbox format and location automatically if
[[setting,mail_driver]] aren't set, but it's still a good idea to explicitly
tell Dovecot where to find the mails. This ensures that Dovecot behaves
correctly also when the user's mailbox doesn't exist at the moment (eg. a new
user). If Dovecot can't figure out where the existing mails are, it will give
an error message and quits. It never tries to create a missing mailbox when
autodetection is used.

See [[link,mail_location]] for more information how to configure the
mailbox location.

Below are the highlights for mbox and maildir.

### mbox

The `/var/mail/username` mbox is called user's INBOX. IMAP protocol
supports multiple mailboxes however, so Dovecot needs some directory
where to store the other mailboxes. Typically they're stored in
`~/mail/` or `~/Mail/` directory. All of these locations are
included in mailbox location autodetection. You can specify them
manually with:

```[dovecot.conf]
mail_driver = mbox
mail_path = ~/mail
mail_inbox_path = /var/mail/%u
```

Remember that the [[setting,mail_path]] setting is the mailbox root directory,
don't try to use the INBOX `/var/mail/%u` path in there because that
isn't going to work (unless you really want to store mails under
`/var/mail/%u/` directory).

If you're also using other software than Dovecot to access mboxes, you
should try to figure out what locking methods exactly they're using and
update [[setting,mbox_read_locks]] and [[setting,mbox_write_locks]] settings
accordingly. See locking section in [[link,mbox]] for more information.

### Maildir

Maildir is typically stored in `~/Maildir` directory. You can specify
this manually with:

```[dovecot.conf]
mail_driver = maildir
mail_path = ~/Maildir
```

See [[link,maildir]] for more information.

## Chrooting

Dovecot, including several other software, allow using "/./" in home
directory path to specify the chroot path. For example `/home/./user`
would chroot to `/home`. If you want to enable this for Dovecot, add
the chroot path to [[setting,valid_chroot_dirs]] setting (`/home` in the
previous example). If this isn't done, Dovecot ignores the "/./".

See [[link,chrooting]] for more details.
