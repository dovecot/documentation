# Statistics

See [[link,summary_events]] for list of all events that can be used in
statistics.

Dovecot supports gathering statistics from events (see [[link,event_design]]).
Currently there are no statistics logged by default, and therefore they must
be explicitly added using the `metric` configuration blocks.

The [`metric_filter`](#metric_filter) setting is the only required setting in a
[`metric`](#metric) block. It specifies which events should be used when
calculating the statistics for a given metric block. Event filtering is
described in detail in [[link,event_filter]].

Note that Dovecot also has many unnamed events. These aren't generally useful
for statistics, but in some situations they may become visible in statistics.
To avoid surprises, it's a good idea to always specify `event=name` in the
filter setting. You can also use `event=*` to match all named events.

## Settings

<SettingsComponent tag="metrics" />

## Group By

The `group_by` metric setting allows dynamic hierarchical metric
generation based on event fields' values.

Each field listed in the `group_by` generates one level of "sub-metrics".
These automatically generated metrics are indistinguishable from those
statically defined in the config file. "sub-metric" names can be up to
256 bytes in total.

Dovecot supports a number of aggregation functions that can be used to
quantize a field's value before it is used to generate a metric.

The format is always the same: the field name, a colon, the aggregation
function name, and optionally a colon followed by colon delimited parameters
to the aggregation function.

### `discrete`

The simplest aggregation function is to use the value as is.  Because this
is a very common use case, not specifying an aggregation function is treated
as an alias for discrete aggregation.  In other words, `field` and
`field:discrete` produce the same behavior.

[[added,metric_group_by_discrete_modifiers_added]] An additional parameter
can be added to provide modifiers to the discrete value. This is done as
[[link,settings_variables,%variables]] and their modifiers. The following
variables are provided:

* `%{value}` - The original value
* `%{domain}` - Text after the `@` character, or empty string if there is no `@`.

Example:

```[dovecot.conf]
metric imap_command {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished
  group_by = cmd_name tagged_reply_state
}
metric login_domains {
  filter = event=auth_request_finished
  fields = user
  group_by = discrete:%L{domain}
}
```

This example configuration will generate statistics for each IMAP command.
The first "sub-metric" level is based on the IMAP command name, and the
second (and in this example final) level is based on the tagged reply.  For
example, a `SELECT` IMAP command that succeeded (in other words, it had an
`OK` reply) will generate the metric `imap_command_SELECT_ok`.

In addition to the final level metric, all intermediate level metrics are
generated as well.  For example, the same `SELECT` IMAP command will
generate all of the following metrics:

- `imap_command`
- `imap_command_SELECT`
- `imap_command_SELECT_ok`

Note: While the top level metrics (e.g., `imap_command` above) are
generated at start up, all `group_by` metrics are generated dynamically
when first observed.

### `exponential`

The field's integer value is quantized into exponentially sized ranges.

The exponential aggregation function takes three colon delimited integer
arguments that define the set of ranges used: the minimum magnitude, the
maximum magnitude, and the base.  The exact configuration syntax is:
`field:exponential:min:max:base`

Note: Currently, only base 2 and base 10 are supported.

The first range starts at negative infinity and ends at `pow(base, min)`.
The second range begins at `pow(base, min) + 1` and ends at
`pow(base, min + 1)`, the next covers `pow(base, min + 1) + 1` to
`pow(base, min + 2)`, and so on.  The last range covers
`pow(base, max) + 1` to positive infinity.

For example, given the specification `duration:exponential:1:5:10`, the
ranges would be:

* (-inf, 10]
* [11, 100]
* [101, 1000]
* [1001, 10000]
* [10001, 100000]
* [100001, +inf)

Much like the metric names generated with the `discrete` aggregation
function, the ones generated by the `exponential` function include
information about the value of the field.  However, in this case it is the
range the value belongs to.

Specifically, it is the name of the field being quantized, and the lower and
upper bounds for the range.

Example:

```[dovecot.conf]
metric imap_command {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished
  group_by = cmd_name duration:exponential:1:5:10
}
```

This will generate metric names of the format
`imap_command_{cmd}_duration_{min}_{max}` where `{cmd}` is the IMAP
command name, and `{min}` and `{max}` are the range bounds.  Therefore,
for a `SELECT` IMAP command, the possible generated metric names are:

* `imap_command_SELECT_ninf_10`
* `imap_command_SELECT_11_100`
* `imap_command_SELECT_101_1000`
* `imap_command_SELECT_1001_10000`
* `imap_command_SELECT_10001_100000`
* `imap_command_SELECT_100001_inf`

Note: Since the metric names cannot contain `-`, the string `ninf` is used
to denote negative infinity.

Note: Much like in the `discrete` case, the metrics are allocated only
when first observed.

Finally, because all intermediate level metrics are generated as well.  The
above example, will also generate all of the following metrics:

- `imap_command`
- `imap_command_SELECT`

### `linear`

The field's integer value is quantized into linearly sized ranges.

The linear aggregation function takes three colon delimited integer
arguments that define the set of ranges used: the minimum value, the
maximum value, and the range step size.  The exact configuration syntax is:
`field:linear:min:max:step`

The first range starts at negative infinity and ends at `min`.  The second
range begins at `min + 1` and ends at `min + step`, the next covers
`min + step + 1` to `min + (2 * step)`, and so on.  The last range
covers `max + 1` to positive infinity.

For example, given the specification `net_out_bytes:linear:0:5000:1000`, the
ranges would be:

* (-inf, 0]
* [1, 1000]
* [1001, 2000]
* [2001, 3000]
* [3001, 4000]
* [4001, 5000]
* [5001, +inf)

See the description of the [exponential](#exponential) aggregation function
for how metric names are formed from these ranges.

## Listing Statistics

The gathered statistics are available by running:

```sh
doveadm stats dump
```

Each event has a `duration` field, which tracks in microseconds how long
the event existed. For example with `imap_command_finished` field it could be:

```
metric_name          field      count  sum       min  max     avg      median stddev %95
imap_commands        duration   35     1190122   162  340477  34003    244    31215  188637
```

The above means:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `count` | There have been 35 IMAP commands |
| `sum` | The IMAP commands were running in total for 1190122 microseconds (= 1.1 seconds) |
| `min` | The fastest IMAP command took 162 microseconds |
| `max` | The slowest IMAP command took 340477 microseconds |
| `avg` | The average time spent on an IMAP commands was 34003 microseconds |
| `median` | The median time spent on an IMAP command was 244 microseconds |
| `stddev` | Standard deviation for the time spent on IMAP commands |
| `%95` | 95% of the IMAP commands took 188637 microseconds or less |

The other fields (than duration) track whatever that field represents. For
example with imap_command_finished's `net_in_bytes` field could be tracking
how many bytes were being used by the IMAP commands. Non-numeric fields can
also be tracked, although only the `count` is relevant to those.

The list of fields can be specified with the `-f` parameter. The default is:

```sh
doveadm stats dump -f 'count sum min max avg median stddev %95'
```

It's also possible to specify other percentiles than just 95%, for example:

```sh
doveadm stats dump -f 'count sum min max avg median stddev %95 %99 %99.9 %99.99'
```

The stats counters are reset whenever the stats process is started, which
also means a dovecot reload will reset statistics. Using `doveadm stats -r`
parameter will also reset the statistics atomically after they're dumped.

## Modifying Statistics Dynamically

Metrics can be added or removed dynamically. The changes do not persist
after configuration reload.

Metrics can be added dynamically by running [[doveadm,stats add]].

* `exporter`: See [[setting,metric_exporter]].
* `exporter-include`: See [[setting,metric_exporter_include]].
* `fields`: See [[setting,metric_fields]].
* `group-by`: See [[link,stats_group_by]].
* `<filter>`: See [[setting,metric_filter]].

For example:

```sh
doveadm stats add --description "IMAP SELECT commands" \
  --exporter log-exporter --exporter-include "name timestamps" \
  --fields "net_in_bytes net_out_bytes" \
  --group-by "cmd_name tagged_reply_state" imap_cmd_select \
  "event=imap_command_finished AND cmd_name=SELECT"
```

Metrics can be removed dynamically by running [[doveadm,stats remove]].

For example:

```sh
doveadm stats remove imap_cmd_select
```

## Examples

### IMAP Command Statistics

```[dovecot.conf]
metric imap_select_no {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished AND cmd_name=SELECT AND \
      tagged_reply_state=NO
}

metric imap_select_no_notfound {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished AND cmd_name=SELECT AND \
      tagged_reply="NO*Mailbox doesn't exist:*"
}

metric storage_http_gets {
  filter = event=http_request_finished AND category=storage AND \
      method=get
}

# generate per-command metrics on successful commands
metric imap_command {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished AND tagged_reply_state=OK
  group_by = cmd_name
}
```

### Push Notifications

```[dovecot.conf]
metric push_notifications {
  filter = event=push_notification_finished
}

# for OX driver
metric push_notification_http_finished {
  filter = event=http_request_finished AND category=push_notification
}
```

## OpenMetrics

### Basic Configuration

Dovecot has support for [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) exposition
format for statistics.

This can be enabled by adding following configuration:

```[dovecot.conf]
service stats {
  inet_listener http {
    port = 9900
  }
}
```

This will enable Dovecot to expose all configured metrics in OpenMetrics
format on `http://host:9900/metrics` using
[text-based format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-based-format).

### Statistics Format

By default, Dovecot exposes all configured metrics.

If the metric name does not conform with OpenMetrics requirements, it is not
exported.

All metric names are prefixed with `dovecot_` and each non-histogram metric
is exported as `dovecot_<metric_name>_total` and
`dovecot_<metric_name>_duration_seconds_total`.

Dynamically generated statistics with [group_by](#group-by) will be exported
too.

The name of the base metric is used as above, and any dynamically generated
sub-metrics are exported using labels.

Quantized sub-metrics are exported as histograms.

Histograms are exported as `dovecot_<metric_name>_bucket` with corresponding
labels. Each histogram will have an automatically generated `_sum`
(specifying sum of all values in quantiles) and `_count` (total number
of samples in the quantiles) metrics.

Dovecot will also export version information and startup time as special
metrics even if nothing is configured. These are called `dovecot_build_info`
and `process_start_time_seconds`.

### Example

and the sample exported data with such metrics configuration:

::: code-group
```[dovecot.conf]
metric auth_success {
  filter = (event=auth_request_finished AND success=yes)
}

metric imap_command {
  filter = event=imap_command_finished
  group_by = cmd_name tagged_reply_state
}

metric smtp_command {
  filter = event=smtp_server_command_finished
  group_by = cmd_name status_code duration:exponential:1:5:10
}

metric mail_delivery {
  filter = event=mail_delivery_finished
  group_by = duration:exponential:1:5:10
}
```
