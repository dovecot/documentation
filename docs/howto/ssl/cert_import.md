# SSL Certificate Importing to Clients

You may import either the server's self-signed certificate or the CA
certificate (see [certificate_creation](cert_create)).

## Windows 11

See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates

## Mac OS X

- Doubleclick the certificate

- Keychain should open

- Add the certificate to X509 Anchors keychain

Apple Mail uses the OS X's certificate store.

## Thunderbird

Preferences -> Privacy -> Security -> View Certificates -> Authorities
-> Import -> Trust this CA to identify email users.

## Opera Mail

Preferences -> Advanced > Security > Certificates > Import certificate
file.

## Evolution

Preferences -> Certificates -> Authorities -> Import -> Trust this CA to
identify email users.

## Mutt

See https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/-/wikis/MuttGuide/UseIMAP

## Pine

http://www.madboa.com/geek/pine-ssl/ tells a story how to do this.
Basically it seems to be:

1. Find out your OPENSSLDIR: `openssl version -d`

2. Get a hash of your certificate:
   `openssl x509 -in cert.pem -hash -noout`

3. Copy the certificate to `$OPENSSLDIR/certs/$hash.0`

This probably works only for self-signed certificates.

## KMail

See https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kmail/kmail2/manual-configuration-quickstart.html

## Claws Mail

Configuration -> Edit accounts (Choose here your's one and press
'Edit'-button)

Account -> SSL -> Certificate for receiving->Browse
