# SSL Certificate Creation

## Self-signed SSL Certificates

Self-signed SSL certificates are the easiest way to get your SSL server
working. However unless you take some action to prevent it, **this is
at the cost of security**:

* The first time the client connects to the server, it sees the
  certificate and asks the user whether to trust it. The user, of course,
  doesn't really bother verifying the certificate's fingerprint, so a
  man-in-the-middle attack can easily bypass all the SSL security, steal
  the user's password and so on.
* If the client was lucky enough not to get attacked the first time it
  connected, the following connections will be secure as long as the
  client had permanently saved the certificate. Some clients do this,
  while others have to be manually configured to accept the certificate.

The only way to be fully secure is to import the SSL certificate to
client's (or operating system's) list of trusted CA certificates prior
to first connection. See [certificate importing](cert_import) for how to
do it for different clients.

### Self-signed Certificate Creation

Dovecot includes a script to build self-signed SSL certificates using
OpenSSL. In the source distribution this exists in
https://github.com/dovecot/core/blob/main/doc/mkcert.sh. Binary
installations usually create the certificate automatically when
installing Dovecot and don't include the script.

The SSL certificate's configuration is taken from
https://dovecot.org/doc/dovecot-openssl.cnf file. Modify the file
before running mkcert.sh. Especially important field is the CN (Common
Name) field, which should contain your server's host name. The clients
will verify that the CN matches the connected host name, otherwise
they'll say the certificate is invalid. It's also possible to use
wildcards (eg. \*.domain.com) in the host name. They should work with
most clients.

By default the certificate is created to `/etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.pem`
and the private key file is created to `/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem`.
Also by default the certificate will expire in 365 days. If you wish to
change any of these, modify the `mkcert.sh` script.

## Certificate Authorities

The correct way to use SSL is to have each SSL certificate signed by
a Certificate Authority (CA). The client has a list of trusted
Certificate Authorities, so whenever it sees a new SSL certificate signed
by a trusted CA, it will automatically trust the new certificate without
asking the user any questions.

There are two ways to get a CA signed certificate: get it from an
external CA, or create your own CA.

The clients have a built-in list of trusted CAs, so getting it from one
of those CAs will have the advantage of the certificate working without
any client configuration. There are already-trusted-CAs where you can buy
the certificate, and there are already-trusted-CAs where you can get
your certificate for free.

On the other hand, if you create your own CA, you'll have to install
the CA certificate to all the clients.

So the two options end up being three:

1. Get it from an external CA (which already have the public keys
   installed on the clients, so the clients trust the CA)
   * Purchase the certificate.
   * Get a free certificate.
2. Create your own CA (in this case you'll have to add the CA public
   keys into the clients, as you are not trusted by default)

If you choose "1.ii", there is https://letsencrypt.org where you need
to do some technical effort to demonstrate to a robot that you own
the domains for which the certificate is issued.

LetsEncrypt is an initiative of the Internet Security Research Group
(ISRG), with board members from Cisco, Mozilla and the University of
Michigan among others and technical advisors from Akamai, Google,
Electronic Frontier Foundation, Internet Society and independents
among others.

LetsEncrypt CA is trusted by default by many clients. If you can
control the entries in your DNS, you'll be able to demonstrate to the
robot that "you are you" for domain-based identities.

If you choose "2", there are multiple different tools for managing your
own CA. The simplest way is to use a CA managing tool as
[gnoMint](https://gnomint.sourceforge.net/) or
[TinyCA](https://opsec.eu/src/tinyca/).

However, if you need to tailor the properties of the CA, you always can
use OpenSSL, very much customizable, but however a bit cumbersome.
