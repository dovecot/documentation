1.  Introduction

   This document extends Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called "SEARCH=MIMEPART".  [FIXME]

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  IMAP Protocol Changes

   The IMAP extension for searching in MIME parts of messages is present
   in any IMAP4 implementation that advertises "SEARCH=MIMEPART" as one
   of the supp capabilities in the CAPABILITY response or response code.

3.1.  MIMEPART SEARCH Key

   With standard IMAP, the MIME structure of a message can only be
   inspected individually for each message using the BODYSTRUCTURE item
   of the FETCH command.  It not possible to formulate a SEARCH command
   with criteria that are based on the MIME structure.  Such searches
   require iteratively inspecting each message individually using the
   FETCH command, which is highly inefficient.  With the new MIMEPART
   search key for the SEARCH command, a client can search messages based
   on attributes of the message's MIME body parts.

   The MIMEPART search key matches messages that have at least one MIME
   part that matches the given MIMEPART searching criteria.  Much like
   the generic searching criteria for the SEARCH command itself, the
   MIMEPART searching criteria consist of one or more MIMEPART keys.

Internet-Draft      IMAP - SEARCH=MIMEPART Extension           July 2017


   However, unlike the generic searching criteria, the MIMEPART keys are
   tested against every single MIME part rather than the message as a
   whole.  This means that when multiple MIMEPART keys are specified
   (always within brackets), the result is all messages that have at
   least one MIME part that by itself matches the intersection (AND
   function) of all of those keys.  Union (OR function) and negation
   (NOT function) are achieved with special "OR" and "NOT" keys
   respectively, much like the generic search key equivalents.

   Although the MIMEPART keys look similar to the generic search keys,
   these only apply within the context of the MIMEPART search key.
   Conversely, it is generally not possible to use generic search keys
   within the MIMEPART search key, unless an identically-named MIMEPART
   key is defined here explicitly.  And, since a MIME part is matched
   rather than a whole message, the semantics of the MIMEPART key
   equivalent will differ accordingly.

   Unlike generic IMAP search keys, MIMEPART keys that use strings do
   not always use a substring match.  The description of each MIMEPART
   key that uses strings indicates what kind of string match it employs.
   Just like the generic IMAP search keys, the matching of MIMEPART keys
   is case-insensitive.

   The defined MIMEPART keys are described in the following paragraphs.
   Refer to the Formal Syntax section for the precise syntactic
   definitions of the arguments for each key.

   The following MIMEPART keys can match any message part.

   HEADER <field-name> <string>
      Message parts that have a header with the specified field-name (as
      defined in [IMAIL]) and that contains the specified string in the
      text of the header (what comes after the colon).  If the string to
      search is zero-length, this matches all message parts that have a
      header line with the specified field-name regardless of the
      contents.

   NOT <mpart-key>
      Message parts that do not match the specified MIMEPART key.

   OR <mpart-key1> <mpart-key2>
      Message parts that match either MIMEPART key.

   SIZE <n>
      Message parts with an RFC 5322 [IMAIL] size equal to the specified
      number of octets.

   SIZE SMALLER/LARGER <n>

      Message parts with an RFC 5322 [IMAIL] size smaller/larger than
      the specified number of octets.

      [MIME-IMB]) equal to the specified string.

   PARAM <string> <string>
      Message parts that have a MIME content parameter with the
      specified name (as defined in [MIME-IMB]) and that contains the
      specified string in the value of the parameter.  If the string to
      search is zero-length, this matches all message parts that have a
      MIME parameter with the specified name regardless of the value.

   ID <string>
      Message parts that have a MIME content id (as defined in
      [MIME-IMB]) equal to the specified string.

      Message parts that have a MIME content disposition parameter with
      the specified name (as defined in [DISPOSITION]) and that contains
      the specified string in the value of the parameter.  If the string
      to search is zero-length, this matches all message parts that have
      a MIME parameter with the specified name regardless of the value.

      Message parts that have a MIME content language tag (as defined in
      [LANGUAGE-TAGS]) equal to the specified string.

   LOCATION <string>
      Message parts that have a MIME body content URI (as defined in
      [LOCATION]) equal to the specified string.

      Message parts that have a MIME content transfer encoding (as
      defined in [MIME-IMB]) equal to the specified string.

   DEPTH <number>
      Message parts that are located in the message at the specified
      hierarchical depth.  A depth of "0" refers to the top-level part,
      which is normally the message itself (see the "CHILD" key below
      for the exception).

   DEPTH MIN/MAX <number>
      Message parts that are located in the message at a level deeper/
      shallower than the specified minimum/maximum hierarchical depth.

   INDEX <number>
      Message parts that are at the specified position index in a
      multipart MIME part.  The first child part is at index "1".

   The following MIMEPART keys can only match message parts that have a
   MIME type other than "multipart"

   BODY <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in their body.

   TEXT <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in their header or
      body.

   The following MIMEPART keys can only match message parts with MIME
   type "message" and subtype "rfc822".

   BCC <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's BCC field.

   CC <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's CC field.

   FROM <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's FROM field.

      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's MESSAGE-ID field.

   REPLY-TO <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's REPLY-TO field.

   SENDER <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's SENDER field.

   SENTBEFORE <date>
      Message parts whose RFC 5322 [IMAIL] Date: header disregarding
      time and timezone) is earlier than the specified date.

   SENTON <date>
      Message parts whose RFC 5322 [IMAIL] Date: header (disregarding
      time and timezone) is within the specified date.

   SENTSINCE <date>
      Message parts whose RFC 5322 [IMAIL] Date: header (disregarding
      time and timezone) is within or later than the specified date.

      structure's SUBJECT field.

   TO <string>
      Message parts that contain the specified string in the envelope
      structure's TO field.

   The following MIMEPART keys can only match message parts that have
   content disposition type "attachment" and include a content
   disposition parameter "filename".  If the string to search is zero-
   length, these keys match all message parts for which such a
   "filename" parameter exists, with the exception of the "FILENAME IS"
   key.

   FILENAME IS <string>
      Message parts for which the full file name is equal to the
      specified string.

   FILENAME CONTAINS <string>
      Message parts for which the file name contains the specified
      string.

   FILENAME BEGINS <string>

      Message parts for which the file name begins with the specified
      string.

   FILENAME ENDS <string>
      Message parts for which the file name ends with the specified
      string.

   The following MIMEPART keys allow formulating criteria based on
   relationships between message parts.

   CHILD <mpart-key>
      Message parts that have a child message part that matches the
      specified MIMEPART search key.  When used inside the "CHILD" key,
      the "DEPTH" key measures the depth relative to the message part
      the "CHILD" key is currently evaluated for.  A depth of "1" refers
      to the children directly below that message part.  A depth of "0"
      will not occur in this context.

   CHILD EXISTS
      Message parts that have any child message part.

   PARENT <mpart-key>
      Message parts with a parent message part that matches the
      specified MIMEPART search key.  This will never match for the top-
      level message itself, since it has no parent.

   PARENT EXISTS
      Message parts that have a parent; i.e., message parts that are not
      the top-level message itself.
