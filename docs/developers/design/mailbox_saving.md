# Mailbox Saving

Both saving and copying messages begins by calling
`mailbox_save_alloc()`.

## Message Metadata Fields

When copying, most of the metadata fields are automatically copied from
the source message. The only exception is message's flags and keywords.
If you want to preserve them, the easiest way is to call
`mailbox_save_copy_flags()`.

### `mailbox_save_set_flags()`

Set flags and keywords.

### `mailbox_save_set_received_date()`

Set message's received date (IMAP INTERNALDATE). It also supports specifying
timezone, but most backends don't support saving it.

### `mailbox_save_set_from_envelope()`

Set the envelope sender.

Currently this is only used by mbox format to specify the address in From-line.

### `mailbox_save_set_min_modseq()`

Set message's modseq to at least the specified modseq. If the modseqs are
already higher in the mailbox, the resulting modseq is what it would have been
without this call.

Mainly useful when you're restoring an existing mailbox and want to preserve
metadata.

### `mailbox_save_set_uid()`

Set message's UID. If mailbox's next_uid is already higher than the specified
UID, the UID request is ignored.

metadata.

### `mailbox_save_set_guid()`

Set message's globally unique ID. A new GUID is generated by default, and if
there already exists a message with the same GUID a different one may or
may not be given. For example with maildir the GUID is same as the base
filename, while dbox has an explicit GUID metadata field.

### `mailbox_save_set_pop3_uidl()`

Set POP3 UIDL value. Not all backends support this.

### `mailbox_save_set_save_date()`

Set "message saved" date, i.e. the date/time when the message was saved to
this mailbox. The default is the current time.

## Saving

Once you're done with setting the metadata fields, you can either copy
an existing mail with `mailbox_copy()` or provide message body with:

### `mailbox_save_begin()`

Start saving from given input stream.

### `mailbox_save_continue()`

Save all data from input stream. If input stream is blocking, typically a
single call to this function should be enough. If input stream is
non-blocking, you need to call this function until you're done. In any case
call this until `i_stream_is_eof()` returns TRUE.

### `mailbox_save_finish()`

Finish saving the mail, or:

### `mailbox_save_cancel()`

Abort saving the mail.

### `mailbox_save_get_dest_mail()`

Give access to the mail whose saving/copying was just finished (but not
committed). You should be able to do pretty much anything with the mail, but
its UID is usually 0 at this point.
