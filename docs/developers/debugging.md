# Debugging Tips

## Debug Pre-auth IMAP with libexec/dovecot/imap

The imap executable can be started in IMAP PREAUTH mode. This
circumvents login and authorization and lets you connect to the
imap process directly, without having to go through the imap-login
process.

Start imap in PREAUTH with one of:

```sh
/usr/libexec/dovecot/imap -u <username>
src/imap/imap -u <username>
doveadm exec imap -u <username>
```

This also works for pop3 and managesieve. lmtp can also be started from
command line without the -u parameter (because the recipient is given
with RCPT TO command).

## Debug Pre-auth IMAP with a Real Client

1. Run the following script:

   ```sh
   rm -f /tmp/f && mkfifo /tmp/f && \
   cat /tmp/f | ./imap -u testuser | nc -l 127.0.0.1 143 > /tmp/f
   ```

2. Connect to port 143 with the imap client of your choice.

3. Attach with gdb to the running imap process, if you so wish.
   This can also be used together with imaptest, if you define
   imaptest to use only one username. Some configurations or use
   cases might require dovecot to be running (e.g. for
   authentication). In those cases, select a different port for
   "nc" or change dovecot not to listen on 143.

## Debug Most Dovecot Executables Inside the Source Tree

To avoid having to make install dovecot before running an executable in
gdb or valgrind, use libtool. For example:

```sh
libtool e gdb --args src/imap/imap
```

Maybe add a helpful alias to your `.bashrc` or similar:

```bash
alias lgdb='libtool --mode=execute gdb'
```

## Debug Dovecot Master

```
GDB=1 gdb --args dovecot -F
```

Start with `-F` = foreground mode.

If you've compiled --with-devel-checks, GDB=1 environment needs to be
set so it doesn't fail when it detects extra "leaked" file descriptors.

## Standalone Non-Root Debugging Environments

Dovecot can be instructed to run the imap handler as a non-root user,
and therefore that binary can be debugged by that same non-root user. At
the moment, only manual (telnet) interaction is possible. This setup is
documented in [[link,rootless]].

## Disabling Optimizations

gdb can be difficult if code is compiled with optimizations (-O2).
Printing variables may fail and stepping over code can jump confusingly
all over the place. The easiest way to avoid this is to just disable
optimizations either for Dovecot entirely or just some files:

- Globally: `EXTRA_CFLAGS=-O0 ./configure ...`

- Within a directory: Remove -O2 from CFLAGS in Makefile

  - Edit/touch some .c file(s) in the directory to recompile, or make
    clean to rebuild everything in the directory

If you want to just select a few functions to be built with -O0, then
create 2 files, src/lib/optimise-off.h and src/lib/options-restore.h as
follows:

```c
#if defined(__GNUC__)
#if (__GNUC__ > 4) || ((__GNUC__ == 4) && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 4))
#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC optimize (0)
#else
#warning GCC not new enough to support local optimization pragmas
#endif
#endif
```

and

```c
#if defined(__GNUC__)
#if (__GNUC__ > 4) || ((__GNUC__ == 4) && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 4))
#pragma GCC pop_options
#else
/* He already knows */
#endif
#endif
```

Then just use #include those files around just the functions you want
un-optimised.

Another dirty and quick way to opt out the optimization is to use pragma
to quote the code.

```c
#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC optimize ("O0")
.... code
#pragma GCC pop_options
```

## Debugging Core Dumps in Other Systems

You need the core dump, the binary that produced it and ALL the shared
libraries on the system. For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

binary=/usr/libexec/dovecot/imap
core=/var/core/core.12345
dest=core.tar.gz
(echo "info shared"; sleep 1) |
  gdb $binary $core |
  grep '^0x.*/' | sed 's,^[^/]*,,' |
  xargs tar czf $dest --dereference $binary $core
```

## Debugging Core Dumps in Other Systems

::: todo
Move to Dovecot Pro documentation.
:::

If you have a tar.gz generated from dovecot-sysreport, you can debug it
in any Linux distribution. But you still need to have the Dovecot
debuginfo packages installed globally, which could be a bit tricky.

With yum based systems you can setup /etc/yum.repos.d/dovecot.repo pointing
to the repository you want according to
https://doc.dovecot.org/installation_guide/dovecot_pro_releases/. Then
you can install the packages easily with:

```sh
rpm -Uvh --nodeps $(repoquery --location dovecot-ee-debuginfo)
```

## Scripting gdb for Getting Backtrace From Many Core Dumps

When you have tens of core dumps, it's getting a bit troublesome to
manually get the backtraces. Here's a script that takes a number of
dovecot-sysreport-*.tar.gz files as parameters and
creates dovecot-sysreport-*.tar.bt output files for them:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

for fname in $*; do
  mkdir tmp-gdb
  cd tmp-gdb
  tar xzf ../$fname
  core_path=$(find . -name '*core*')
  # FIXME: handles only libexec files - should also support doveadm at least
  binary_name=$(file $core_path \| grep "dovecot/" \| sed "s/^.*from 'dovecot\/\([^']*\).*$/\1/")
  cat <<EOF | gdb usr/libexec/dovecot/$binary_name > ../$fname.bt
set pagination off
set solib-absolute-prefix .
core $core_path
bt full
quit
EOF
  cd ..
  rm -rf tmp-gdb
done
```

## Following Deep Inside Structs

Dovecot implements classes/objects using C structs. For example there is the
`struct connection` base object, which is extended with:

```c
struct dict_connection {
    struct connection conn;
    ...
}
```

However, many places still refer to these extended objects using their base
classes, so you need to cast them to get all of their wanted fields visible.
For example:

```c
(gdb) p dict_connections
$1 = (struct connection_list *) 0x55823025e9a0
(gdb) p dict_connections.connections
$2 = (struct connection *) 0x55823025c160
(gdb) p *dict_connections.connections
$3 = {prev = 0x0, next = 0x0, list = 0x55823025e9a0,
... the rest of struct connection
(gdb) p *(struct dict_connection *)dict_connections.connections
$4 = {conn = {prev = 0x0, next = 0x0, list = 0x55823025e9a0,
... the rest of struct dict_connection
```

It's a bit more tricky to look inside dynamic array types. As an example
lets consider `ARRAY(struct dict_connection_cmd *) cmds`. This ends up
being expanded into:

```c
struct array {
    buffer_t *buffer;
    size_t element_size;
};
union {
    struct array arr;
    struct dict_connection_cmd *const *v;
    struct dict_connection_cmd **v_modifiable;
} cmds;
```

You can find out the size of the array with:

```c
p cmds.arr.buffer.used / cmds.arr.element_size
```

You can access the elements of the array with:

```c
p *(*cmds.v)[0]
p *(*cmds.v)[1]
p *(*cmds.v)[...]
```

So to actually access the `dict_connection.cmds` array for the first
connection in `dict_connections`, the gdb print commands get a bit long:

```c
(gdb) p ((struct dict_connection *)dict_connections.connections).cmds
$5 = {arr = {buffer = 0x55823026da80, element_size = 8}, v = 0x55823026da80,
      v_modifiable = 0x55823026da80}

(gdb) p ((struct dict_connection *)dict_connections.connections).cmds.arr.buffer.used / 8
$6 = 1

(gdb) p *(*((struct dict_connection *)dict_connections.connections).cmds.v)[0]
$7 = {cmd = 0x55822ecc8b00 <cmds+16>, conn = 0x55823025c160, start_timeval = {
      tv_sec = 1632257119, tv_usec = 530341}, event = 0x558230280b98,
      reply = 0x0, iter = 0x0, iter_flags = 0, async_reply_id = 0, trans_id = 0,
      rows = 0, uncork_pending = false}
```

There can of course be multiple dict connections, which you can access by
following the linked list:

```c
(gdb) p *dict_connections.connections.next
(gdb) p *dict_connections.connections.next.next
(gdb) p *dict_connections.connections.next.next.next
```

## Debugging Data Stack Growth

Dovecot uses [[link,data_stack]] to implement its own secondary stack.
This stack is intended to usually stay rather small, ideally within its
initial 32 kB size. There are `data_stack_grow` events sent when it grows.
To debug why data stack grows, you can have it panic:

```
log_core_filter = event=data_stack_grow
# Or have it panic later:
log_core_filter = event=data_stack_grow and alloc_size >= 10240
```

The core dump can then be analyzed:

```c
(gdb) p *current_frame
$1 = {prev = 0x555555874e78, block = 0x555555910760, block_space_left = 15640,
      last_alloc_size = 96, marker = 0x5555557e726c "data-stack.c:514",
      alloc_bytes = 96, alloc_count = 1}
(gdb) p *current_frame.prev
$2 = {prev = 0x555555874e18, block = 0x5555558742a0, block_space_left = 7264,
      last_alloc_size = 744, marker = 0x5555557c011f "index-storage.c:1056",
      alloc_bytes = 7312, alloc_count = 71}
(gdb) p *current_frame.prev.block
$3 = {prev = 0x0, next = 0x555555910760, size = 10240, left = 696,
      left_lowwater = 696, canary = 0xbadbadd5badbadd5, data = 0x5555558742d0 "8"}
```

First look at the `block` variable for these frames, and note how it changes
for the 2rd one. So the data stack is grown between the 1nd and the 2rd frame.
And since `block_space_left` was about 7 kB while the block's full size was
10240 bytes, most of the space is allocated sometimes after
`index-storage.c:1056`. We can also look further into the data stack frames
to see if there are any other frames that use up a lot of memory:

```c
(gdb) p *current_frame.prev.prev
$4 = {prev = 0x555555874db8, block = 0x5555558742a0, block_space_left = 7360,
      last_alloc_size = 96, marker = 0x5555557aef7c "mail-storage.c:2818",
      alloc_bytes = 96, alloc_count = 1}
...
$5 = {prev = 0x5555558743e0, block = 0x5555558742a0, block_space_left = 8440,
      last_alloc_size = 560, marker = 0x5555557a5467 "cmd-copy.c:328",
      alloc_bytes = 984, alloc_count = 6}
(gdb) p *current_frame.prev.prev.prev.prev.prev
$6 = {prev = 0x555555874338, block = 0x5555558742a0, block_space_left = 9976,
      last_alloc_size = 112, marker = 0x5555557a720f "imap-client.c:1357",
      alloc_bytes = 1536, alloc_count = 14}
```

So there was also some 1.5 kB used between `imap-client.c:1357` and
`cmd-copy.c:328` which might be worth looking into.

Once you start debugging, get a gdb backtrace and start inserting further data
stack frames into the function calls that the gdb backtrace shows. For example:

```c
(gdb) bt
#0  data_stack_send_grow_event (last_alloc_size=744) at data-stack.c:400
#1  t_malloc_real (size=<optimized out>, permanent=<optimized out>)
    at data-stack.c:523
...
#10 0x000055555565257c in index_list_get_metadata (box=0x5555558ee8b0,
    items=MAILBOX_METADATA_CACHE_FIELDS, metadata_r=0x7fffffffe180)
    at mailbox-list-index-status.c:343
#11 0x00005555555ea928 in mailbox_get_metadata (box=0x5555558ee8b0,
    items=items@entry=MAILBOX_METADATA_CACHE_FIELDS,
    metadata_r=metadata_r@entry=0x7fffffffe180) at mail-storage.c:2204
#12 0x0000555555672794 in index_copy_cache_fields (
    ctx=ctx@entry=0x5555559093b0, src_mail=src_mail@entry=0x555555904408,
    dest_seq=1) at index-storage.c:1068
```

Here you can see that #1 matches is inside the `data-stack.c:514` data
stack frame and #12 is inside the `index-storage.c:1056` data stack frame.
So you could start placing more `T_BEGIN { .. } T_END` frames between
#2 and #11 frames shown by gdb to get more details where the data stack is
being used.

## Valgrind

The most useful Valgrind parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `–-vgdb=no` | Needed on some systems to avoid problems. |
| `--keep-debuginfo=yes` | Prevent unhelpful `??` for already unloaded plugins. |
| `--num-callers=<n>` | Display last \<n\> functions calls in the backtrace for each error. |
| `--leak-check=full` | Show also unfreed memory as being leaked. |
| `--trace-children=yes` | Trace also the forked child processes. |
| `--suppressions=<path>` Suppressions for things that can't be fixed. Usually in external libraries. |
| `-q` | Quiet: don't log about initialization etc. |

### Standalone

```sh
valgrind --leak-check=full /usr/libexec/dovecot/imap -u user@example.com
```

### Service Settings

```
service imap {
  executable = /usr/bin/valgrind --vgdb=no --num-callers=50
               --leak-check=full -q /usr/local/libexec/dovecot/imap
}
```

### Debugging Valgrind errors in a Live Program Using GDB

```sh
valgrind --vgdb-error=0
```

And follow the instructions given by valgrind. Also works within emacs.

### Debugging over forks with Valgrind

If you're an emacs user, you're only allowed to debug one process at a
time (per emacs).

As above,

```sh
valgrind --vgdb-error=0
```

Method 1: Just start the first gdb in a different shell or emacs window
as normal, and then pretty much ignore it. After the fork, pick up the
process in your primary emacs gdb window as normal.

Method 2: Follow the gdb instructions, "cont" the program, ^C, and
"detach" the program. I'm not sure what happens to the parent after
that. When valgrind stops on the fork, follow the new set of gdb
instructions and continue as normal.

In neither method do you need to "set follow-fork-mode child" as gdb
isn't aware of the fork.

### Valgrinding Plugin Memory Leaks

Valgrind output at exit may contain very unhelpful `??` lines, which
point to already unloaded plugins. You can avoid this by
giving `--keep-debuginfo=yes` parameter.

Alternative way would be to set GDB=1 environment to disable all plugin
unloading. This will cause some extra warnings about leaking memory in
dl\*() functions which can be ignored. You can also do this in
dovecot.conf:

```
import_environment = $import_environment GDB=1
```
