# dovecot-ce-documentation

Static website content for Dovecot CE documentation.

## Site Generation Software

The site is statically generated via the
[VitePress](https://www.vitepress.dev/) framework.

VitePress is a Javascript application.  The content pages use markdown, with
the ability to layer additional VitePress (and [Vue](https://www.vuejs.org))
functionality on top of it, i.e. the ability to use templates/variables to
generate page content.

Most maintenance tasks on the Javascript code use simple functionality using
basic Javscript components. The Mozilla reference page might be useful if
there are any questions:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference

Markdown reference: https://www.markdownguide.org/

Configuration of VitePress is in the `.vitepress/config.js` file.

### Prerequisites

From [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started#prerequisites):

* Node.js version 18 or higher

::: warning
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (and prior) does NOT contain a new enough version of nodejs.

Either run in a container (see https://hub.docker.com/\_/node) or install
via out-of-band packages (see https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).
:::

## Installation

To install, run:

```console
$ npm install
# Or using bun (https://bun.sh/):
#$ bun install
```

## Local Testing Server

VitePress provides a local development server that will do real-time updates
when source files change.

::: warning
This must be run from the base of the project!
:::

Run with:

```console
$ npm run docs:dev
# or:
#$ bun run docs:dev
```

::: warning
Note: Certain features (such as search) will not work in testing/dev mode and
require the documentation to be statically built and served.
:::

## Documentation Generation

To generate the static documentation, run:

```console
$ npm run docs:build
# or:
#$ bun run docs:build
```

Generated documentation will be output in the `docs/.vitepress/dist` directory.
The statically generated documentation can be displayed locally by running:

```console
$ npm run docs:preview
# or:
#$ bun run docs:preview
```

### Debugging

Depending on when an issue occurs, errors may be displayed on the development
screen (and in the terminal where the docs:dev command is being run).

However, some errors only occur when viewing a page, and will oftentimes
result in a blank or incomplete page render. In these cases, looking at the
browser developer console will generally show the error that has occurred.

## Dovecot-specific VitePress Features

### Directory Structure

`docs/` contains the pages to be rendered by VitePress into the site.

### Sidebar Generation

The sidebar is automatically generated via the
[vitepress-sidebar](https://github.com/jooy2/vitepress-sidebar) plugin.

It will create the sidebar based on the file layout in the `docs/` directory.

The title is configured via the `title` parameter in the
[frontmatter](https://vitepress.dev/guide/frontmatter) content of the page.

Any page can be excluded from output by setting the `exclude` parameter to
`true` in the frontmatter content of the page.

Header titles can be set via the `index.md` file in the folder. This file
can be hidden by setting the `exclude` parameter to `true`.

### Dovecot Data Generation

Dovecot has several systems (configuration, doveadm, events, etc.) that can
be added throughout the code and need a way to collect and handle the
documentation in a single location.

This is accomplished by maintaining a "database" of these elements in a
special data file. These data files can then be processed via simple javascript
and HTML templating to vastly simplify the output of this common data.

Additionally, this allows this information to be maintained in a single place
and shown on multiple pages. For example, it is useful on a plugins page to
show all configuration settings related to that plugin, but it is also useful
to have a page that shows all information on all plugin settings.

The data files live in the base `/data` directory. Each file attempts to be
self-documenting, but they are all essentially large JSON objects. Developers
should need to know basically no Javascript to be able to edit the files.

### Dovecot Markdown Extensions

Markdown has been extended to allow various Dovecot-specific tasks to be
performed.

This Markdown works in both the base pages and in many database fields
(see documentation in `data/*.data.js` for the fields that support Markdown).

Dovecot specific Markdown commands are wrapped in `[[...]]` syntax.

#### Doveadm Commands

Syntax: `[[doveadm,command_string(,args)]]` (args is optional)

`command_string` should NOT include "doveadm" - this will automatically be
added in the output.

If args is set, it is appended to the display as doveadm arguments. Example:

```
# [[doveadm,foo,--bar &lt;baz&gt;]] results in:
<a href="PATH_TO_FOO_COMMAND">doveadm foo --bar &lt;baz%gt;</a>
```

#### Events

Syntax: `[[event,event_name]]`

`event_name` is the name of the Dovecot event to link to.

#### Link

VitePress does not support inter-documentation linking, by default.

However, this wiki-like linking is useful and, thus, has been implemented
in Dovecot's implementation of VitePress.

Dovecot linking "tags" are defined in a page's Frontmatter (the YAML at
the top of the page) under the `dovecotlinks` key.

`dovecotlinks` keys are the link tags.  Values are one of two formats:

* If text, this the default text associated with the tag. A link to this tag
  will link the to base page.
* If an object, it must define two sub-keys: `hash` and `text`
  * `hash` is the anchor on the page to link to when using the tag. The '#'
    MUST not be present. Hash strings can be determined by mousing over
    headers on a page. (Roughly: every non-character is converted to '-'.)
  * `text` is the default text for the tag.

To link to a tag, use the Markdown syntax: `[[link,tag(,optional_text)]]`

#### Man Pages

Syntax: `[[man,command_name(,hash,section)]]`

Links to the man page.

`command_name` is the command to link to (e.g., `doveconf`).

Hash is the section number.  It defaults to empty.

Section is the section number.  It defaults to `1`.

#### Plugin

Syntax: `[[plugin,plugin_name]]`

Links to the plugin page.

#### RFC

Syntax: `[[rfc,rfc_number(,section)]]`

Links to the RFC page (external).

`section` is optional and will link to the RFC subsection.

#### Settings

Syntax: `[[setting,setting_name(,args)]]`

If args is set, it is appended to the display as a setting value. Example:

```
# [[setting,foo,5]] results in:
<a href="PATH_TO_FOO_SETTING">foo = 5</a>
```

#### Variable

Syntax: `[[variable(,section)]]`

Link to the Settings Variable page.

By default, links to the base page.

If section is defined, will link to the sub-section. Valid sub-sections:

* auth
* config (the default)
* global
* login
* mail-service-user
* mail-user

#### Updates (added, changed, deprecated, removed)

Syntax: `[[(update),tag_name]]`

Create a update tag based on a tag_name.

The tag_name must be defined in `data/updates.js`.

Example: `[[changed,tag_name]]`
