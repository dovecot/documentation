Dumpster Config
===============

.. note:: "Dumpster" is an Open-Xchange proprietary App Suite feature that
   will list messages stored in a single Dovecot :ref:`lazy_expunge_plugin`
   mailbox.

This config moves the last copy of a message, when deleted, to a hidden
``EXPUNGED`` mailbox.  Messages in the ``EXPUNGED`` mailbox will be
automatically expunged after 7 days.  Messages in ``EXPUNGED`` will not
count toward the quota limit.  The ``EXPUNGED`` mailbox will NOT be visible
to hosts connecting on any IP other than 127.0.0.2 (App Suite should connect
to Dovecot on this address so that ``EXPUNGED`` can be displayed by the
Dumpster view).

     mailbox EXPUNGED {
       autoexpunge = 7d
