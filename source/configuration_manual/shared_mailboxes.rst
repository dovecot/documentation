Shared mailboxes
=================

Dovecot can support mailbox sharing in several different ways:

 * :ref:`public_shared_mailboxes`: Shared mailboxes created by administrators.
 * :ref:`user_shared_mailboxes`: Users sharing their mailboxes to other users.
 * :ref:`Symlinking mailboxes <sharing_with_symlinks>`: Quick and dirty way of sharing a few mailboxes.
 * :ref:`mailbox_sharing_in_cluster`

 See :ref:`admin_manual_permissions_in_shared_mailboxes` for common filesystem related permission problems that are common with all the sharing methods.
