Pigeonhole Sieve examples
=========================

Below are some simple Sieve code examples, more can be found at
http://sieve.info/examplescripts.

Mail filtering by various headers
---------------------------------

- Use if/elsif/else to store messages into various folders/subfolders:

.. code-block::

      require ["fileinto", "envelope"];
      if address :is "to" "dovecot@dovecot.org" {
        fileinto "Dovecot-list";
      } elsif envelope :is "from" "owner-cipe-l@inka.de" {
        fileinto "lists.cipe";
      } elsif anyof (header :contains "X-listname" "lugog@cip.rz.fh-offenburg.de",
                     header :contains "List-Id" "Linux User Group Offenburg") {
        fileinto "ml.lugog";
      } else {
        # The rest goes into INBOX
        # default is "implicit keep", we do it explicitly here
        keep;
      }


"anyof" means logical OR, "allof" is AND.

- Forward mails with "order" or "buy" in their subject to another address:

.. code-block:: sieve

      if header :contains "subject" ["order", "buy"] {
        redirect "orders@company.dom";
      }

Message-ID and recipient of forwarded message are stored in a
``.dovecot.lda-dupes`` at users home directory to prevent mail loops.

Flagging or Highlighting your mail
----------------------------------

Some mail readers use these flags:

.. code-block:: sieve

   require "imap4flags";
   require "regex";
   if anyof (exists "X-Cron-Env",
             header :regex    ["subject"] [".* security run output",
                                           ".* monthly run output",
                                           ".* daily run output",
                                           ".* weekly run output"]) {
     addflag "$label1"; # ie 'Important'/red label within Thunderbird

   # Other flags:
   # addflag "$label1";  # Important: #ff0000 => red
   # addflag "$label2";  # Work:      #ff9900 => orange
   # addflag "$label3";  # personal:  #009900 => green
   # addflag "$label4";  # todo:      #3333ff => blue
   # addflag "$label5";  # later:     #993399 => violet
   #
   }

Local copy of your emails:

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["envelope", "imap4flags"];
   if envelope "from" "my_address@my_domain.com"
   {
      setflag "\\seen";
   }

Useful, when you want sieve to manage your
incoming **and** outgoing email (you must ask your mail reader to
Bcc your mail to your dovecot in this case).

Spam/Virus rules
----------------

Most spam and virus scanners add a special header to mail messages, so
that users can apply filtering accordingly. Depending on how the Sieve
interpreter is configured, filtering can either be performed by
evaluating these headers directly, or using the spamtest and virustest
extensions.

Direct filtering using message header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evaluating the headers directly is always possible as long as the
headers are actually added to the messages by the scanner software. For
example, to file SpamAssassin-tagged mails into a folder called "Spam":

.. code-block:: sieve

   require "fileinto";
   if header :contains "X-Spam-Flag" "YES" {
     fileinto "Spam";
   }

The following example discards SpamAssassin-tagged mails with level
higher than or equal to 10:

.. code-block:: sieve

   if header :contains "X-Spam-Level" "**********" {
     discard;
     stop;
   }

Some spam scanners only produce a numeric score in a header. Then, the
test becomes more involved:

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["comparator-i;ascii-numeric","relational"];
   if allof (
      not header :matches "x-spam-score" "-*",
      header :value "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "x-spam-score" "10" )
   {
     discard;
     stop;
   }

.. note::
   Be very careful when matching against spam score headers using
   the relational extension and the i;ascii-numeric comparator. This
   comparator can only be used to match unsigned integers. Strings that do
   not begin with a digit character represent positive infinity and will
   therefore always be larger than any score mentioned in your rule! That
   is why the above example first checks the minus sign explicitly.

Filtering using the spamtest and virustest extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the :ref:`spamtest <pigeonhole_extension_spamtest_virustest>`
and :ref:`virustest <pigeonhole_extension_spamtest_virustest>`
extensions are configured on the server
(:ref:`here <pigeonhole_extension_spamtest_virustest>` is explained how), users (and GUIs) can have a much easier way to filter
spam and virus messages respectively. To filter spam, the spamtest
extension can for example be used as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   
   require "spamtestplus";
   require "fileinto";
   require "relational";
   require "comparator-i;ascii-numeric";
   
   /* If the spamtest fails for some reason, e.g. spam header is missing, file
    * file it in a special folder.
    */
   if spamtest :value "eq" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "0" {
     fileinto "Unclassified";
   
   /* If the spamtest score (in the range 1-10) is larger than or equal to 3,
    * file it into the spam folder:
    */
   } elsif spamtest :value "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "3" {
     fileinto "Spam";
   
   /* For more fine-grained score evaluation, the :percent tag can be used. The
    * following rule discards all messages with a percent score
    * (relative to maximum) of more than 85 %:
    */
   } elsif spamtest :value "gt" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" :percent "85" {
     discard;
   }
   
   /* Other messages get filed into INBOX */


The virustest extension can be used in a similar manner:

.. code-block:: sieve
   
   require "virustest";
   require "fileinto";
   require "relational";
   require "comparator-i;ascii-numeric";
   
   /* Not scanned ? */
   if virustest :value "eq" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "0" {
     fileinto "Unscanned";

   /* Infected with high probability (value range in 1-5) */
   } if virustest :value "eq" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "4" {
     /* Quarantine it in special folder (still somewhat dangerous) */
     fileinto "Quarantine";
   
   /* Definitely infected */
   } elsif virustest :value "eq" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "5" {
     /* Just get rid of it */
     discard;
   }

Plus Addressed mail filtering
-----------------------------

Using the `subaddress <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5233/>`__
extension, it is possible to match against the 'detail' part of an
e-mail address, e.g. a '``+tag``' suffix to the local part of the
address. This is for example useful when you don't want just any +tag to
create a directory, but you want to use tagged addresses such as with
amavisd-new. This example would place email addressed to
user+spam@example.com into user's Spam folder.

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["fileinto", "envelope", "subaddress"];
   if envelope :detail "to" "spam"{
     fileinto "Spam";
   }

The following more advanced example uses the
`subaddress <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5233/>`__ extension to handle
recipient addresses structured as ``sales+<name>@company.com`` in a
special way. The ``<name>`` part is extracted from the address using
:ref:`variables <pigeonhole_extension_variables>` extension,
transformed into a format with the first letter in upper case and
subsequently used to create the folder name where the message is stored.
The folder name is structured as ``users/<name>``. If the ``+<name>``
detail is omitted from the recipient address, the message is filed in
the ``sales`` folder.

.. code-block::  

   require ["variables", "envelope", "fileinto", "subaddress"];

   if envelope :is :user "to" "sales" {
     if envelope :matches :detail "to" "*" {
       /* Save name in ${name} in all lowercase except for the first letter.
        * Joe, joe, jOe thus all become 'Joe'.
        */
       set :lower :upperfirst "name" "${1}";
     }

     if string :is "${name}" "" {
       /* Default case if no detail is specified */
       fileinto "sales";
     } else {
       /* For sales+joe@ this will become users/Joe */
       fileinto "users/${name}";
     }
   }

To work with Postfix, this requires that the envelope "to" still
contains the full address, so pass it with the -a flag.

.. code-block:: 

   dovecot unix    -       n       n       -       -      pipe
     flags=DRhu user=mail:mail argv=/usr/local/libexec/dovecot/dovecot-lda
     -f ${sender} -d ${user}@${nexthop} -a ${original_recipient}

or

.. code-block:: 

   mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -a "$RECIPIENT"

Vacation auto-reply
-------------------

Auto-responder functionality is implemented using the
:ref:`vacation <pigeonhole_extension_vacation>` extension. The
following script sends out-of-office replies when the message is not
spam:

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["fileinto", "vacation"];
   # Move spam to spam folder
   if header :contains "X-Spam-Flag" "YES" {
     fileinto "spam";
     # Stop here so that we do not reply on spams
     stop;
   }
   vacation
     # Reply at most once a day to a same sender
     :days 1
     :subject "Out of office reply"
     # List of additional recipient addresses which are included in the auto replying.
     # If a mail's recipient is not the envelope recipient and it's not on this list,
     # no vacation reply is sent for it.
     :addresses ["j.doe@company.dom", "john.doe@company.dom"]
   "I'm out of office, please contact Joan Doe instead.
   Best regards
   John Doe";

It's also possible to include the original subject using the
:ref:`variables <pigeonhole_extension_variables>` extension:

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["variables", "vacation"];
   # Store old Subject line so it can be used in vacation message
   if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
           set "subjwas" ": ${1}";
   }
   vacation
     :days 1
     :subject "Out of office reply${subjwas}"
     :addresses ["j.doe@company.dom", "john.doe@company.dom"]
   "I'm out of office, please contact Joan Doe instead.
   Best regards
   John Doe";

Include scripts
---------------

It's possible to :ref:`include <pigeonhole_extension_include>` other Sieve scripts in your script:

.. code-block::

   require ["include"];
   include :global "global-spam";
   include :personal "my-own-spam";

The lookup directories can be specified with:

.. code-block::

   plugin {
     # Directory for :personal include scripts. The default is to use home directory.
     sieve_dir = %h/sieve

     # Directory for :global include scripts (not to be confused with sieve_global_path).
     # If unset, the include fails.
     sieve_global_dir = /etc/dovecot/sieve/
   }

Both :ref:`plugin-sieve-setting-sieve_dir` and :ref:`plugin-sieve-setting-sieve_global_dir` may also be overridden by
:ref:`userdb extra
fields <authentication-user_extra_field>`.

It's not currently possible to use subdirectories for the scripts.
Having a '/' character in the script name always fails the include. This
is just an extra check to avoid potential problems with including
scripts within mail directories.

Archiving a Mailinglist by Date
-------------------------------

You can archive messages from mailing lists in a date-structured folder
tree as follows:

.. code-block::

   require ["variables","date","fileinto","mailbox"];

   # Extract date info
   if currentdate :matches "year" "*" { set "year" "${1}"; }
   if currentdate :matches "month" "*" { set "month" "${1}"; }

   # Archive Dovecot mailing list items by year and month.
   # Create folder when it does not exist.
   if header :is "list-id" "dovecot.dovecot.org" {
     fileinto :create "INBOX.Lists.${year}.${month}.dovecot";
   }

For example, in March 2013 this puts messages from the Dovecot mailing
list in a folder called ``INBOX.Lists.2013.03.dovecot``. It combines the
`date <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5260#section-4>`__ and
:ref:`variables <pigeonhole_extension_variables>` extensions to
extract the required date strings. Using the ``:create`` argument for
the ``fileinto`` command, the indicated folder is created automatically
if it doesn't exist. The ``:create`` argument is provided by the
`mailbox <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5490#section-3>`__ extension.

Emulating :ref:`lmtp_save_to_detail_mailbox=yes <setting-lmtp_save_to_detail_mailbox>`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you can't turn this option on, you can emulate the behaviour to some
extent with following code.

.. code-block:: sieve

   require ["variables", "fileinto", "envelope", "subaddress", "mailbox"];

   if envelope :matches :detail "to" "*" {
     # you can prefix with INBOX/ or INBOX. if necessary
     # remove :create if you want to permit only existing mailboxes
     fileinto :create "${1}";
   }

Translation from Procmail
-------------------------

There exists a script which attempts to translate simple Procmail rules
into Sieve rules:
http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~steve/sieve/procmail2sieve.pl
(`dovecot.org mirror <http://dovecot.org/tools/procmail2sieve.pl>`__)

Here's the original post announcing it:
