.. _authentication-bsdauth:

=======
BSDAuth
=======

This is similar to :ref:`authentication-pam`, but used by OpenBSD. It supports ``cache_key``
parameter the same way as PAM.

.. Note::

   BSDAuth is deprecated and it is NOT supported by :ref:`ox_dovecot_pro`.
   It will be maintained on a best-effort basis for :ref:`Dovecot Community Edition
   <dovecot_community_repositories>`, based on community patches.

   Users are strongly advised to use :ref:`authentication-pam` instead.
