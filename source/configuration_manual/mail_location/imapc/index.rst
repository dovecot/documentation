  mail_path = 

  # Store index files locally:
  mail_path = ~/imapc

Connection Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_cmd_timeout
   :default: 5 mins
   :values: @time

   How long to wait for a reply to an IMAP command sent to the remote IMAP
   server before disconnecting and retrying.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_connection_retry_count
   :default: 1
   :values: @uint

   How many times to retry connection against a remote IMAP server?


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_connection_retry_interval
   :default: 1 secs
   :values: @time_msecs

   How long to wait between retries against a remote IMAP server?


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_features
   :values: @string

   A space-separated list of features, optimizations, and workarounds that can
   be enabled.

   .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Several features are now automatically
                       enabled and the respective flags dropped. In their place
                       new flags to disable these features were added.

   **Features**

   ``no-acl``

     If the imap-acl plugin is loaded, the imapc acl feature is automatically
     enabled. With it IMAP ACL commands (MYRIGHTS, GETACL, SETACL, DELETEACL)
     are proxied to the imapc remote location. Note that currently these
     commands are attempted to be used even if the remote IMAP server doesn't
     advertise the ACL capability.

     To disable this feature either unload the imap-acl plugin or provide this
     feature.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had an "acl" feature,
                         which is now enabled by default.

   ``no-delay-login``

     Immediately connect to the remote server. By default this is delayed until
     a command requires a connection.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a "delay-login"
                         feature, which is now enabled by default.

   ``gmail-migration``

     Enable GMail-specific migration. Use IMAP ``X-GM-MSGID`` as POP3 UIDL.
     Add ``$GMailHaveLabels`` keyword to mails that have ``X-GM-LABELS``
     except for ``\Muted`` keyword (to be used for migrating only archived
     emails in ``All Mails``). Add :dovecot_core:ref:`pop3_deleted_flag` to
     mails that don't exist in POP3 server.

   ``no-modseq``

     Disable access to ``MODSEQ`` and ``HIGHESTMODSEQ`` fields. By default
     these fields are available if the remote server advertises the CONDSTORE
     or the QRESYNC capability. If modseqs are disabled, or not supported by
     the new server, they can still be used if imapc is configured to have
     local index files.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a "modseq" feature,
                         which is now enabled by default.

   ``proxyauth``

     Use Sun/Oracle IMAP-server specific ``PROXYAUTH`` command to do master
     user authentication. Normally this would be done using the SASL PLAIN
     authentication.

   ``throttle:<INIT>:<MAX>:<SHRINK>``

     When receiving [THROTTLED] response (from GMail), throttling is applied.

     **INIT** = initial throttling msecs (default: 50 ms), afterwards each
     subsequent [THROTTLED] doubles the throttling until **MAX** is reached
     (default: 16000 ms). When [THROTTLED] is not received for a while, it's
     shrank again. The initial shrinking is done after **SHRINK** (default:
     500 ms). If [THROTTLED] is received again within this timeout, it's
     doubled, otherwise both throttling and the next shrinking timeout is
     shrank to 3/4 the previous value.

   **Optimizations**

   ``no-fetch-bodystructure``

     Disable fetching of IMAP ``BODY`` and ``BODYSTRUCTURE`` from the remote
     server. Instead, the whole message body is fetched to regenerate them.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a
                         "fetch-bodystructure" feature, which is now enabled by
                         default.

   ``no-fetch-headers``

     Disable fetching of specific message headers from the remote server using
     the IMAP ``FETCH BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS(...)]`` command. Instead, the
     whole header is fetched and the wanted headers are parsed from it.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a "fetch-headers"
                         feature, which is now enabled by default.

   ``no-fetch-size``

     Disable fetching of message sizes from the remote server using the IMAP
     ``FETCH RFC822.SIZE`` command. Instead, the whole message body is fetched
     to calculate the size.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a "rfc822.size"
                         feature, which is now enabled by default.

   ``no-metadata``

     Disable the detection of the ``METADATA`` capability from the remote server.
     the client will receive a ``NO [UNAVAILABLE]`` response for any request
     that requires access to metadata on the remote server (the same happens if
     the server does not announce the capability at all).

   ``no-search``

     Disable searching messages using the IMAP ``SEARCH`` command. Instead, all
     the message headers/bodies are fetched to perform the search locally.

     .. dovecotchanged:: 2.4.0,3.0.0 Earlier versions had a "search" feature,
                         which is now enabled by default.

   **Workarounds**

   ``fetch-fix-broken-mails``

     If a ``FETCH`` returns ``NO`` (but not ``NO [LIMIT]`` or ``NO
     [SERVERBUG]``), assume the mail is broken in server and just treat it as
     if it were an empty email.

     .. warning:: This is often a dangerous option! It's not safe to assume
                  that ``NO`` means a permanent error rather than a temporary
                  error. This feature should be enabled only for specific
                  users who have been determined to be broken.

   ``fetch-msn-workarounds``

     Try to ignore wrong message sequence numbers in ``FETCH`` replies
     whenever possible, preferring to use the returned UID number instead.

   ``no-examine``

     Use ``SELECT`` instead of ``EXAMINE`` even when we don't want to modify
     anything in the mailbox. This is a Courier-workaround where it didn't
     permanently assign ``UIDVALIDITY`` to an ``EXAMINEd`` mailbox, but assigned
     it for ``SELECTed`` mailbox.

   ``zimbra-workarounds``

     Fetch full message using ``BODY.PEEK[HEADER] BODY.PEEK[TEXT]`` instead of
     just ``BODY.PEEK[]`` because the header differs between these two when
     there are illegal control chars or 8bit chars. This mainly caused
     problems with dsync, but as of v2.2.22+ this should no longer be a
     problem and there's probably no need to enable this workaround.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_host
   :values: @string

   The remote IMAP host to connect to.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_list_prefix
   :values: @string

   Access only mailboxes under this prefix.

   Example, for a source IMAP server that uses an INBOX namespace prefix:

   .. code-block:: none

     imapc_list_prefix = INBOX/


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_master_user
   :seealso: @imapc_password;dovecot_core, @imapc_user;dovecot_core
   :values: @string

   The master username to authenticate as on the remote IMAP host.

   To authenticate as a master user but use a separate login user, the
   following configuration should be employed, where the credentials are
   represented by masteruser and masteruser-secret:

   .. code-block:: none

     imapc_user = %u
     imapc_master_user = masteruser
     imapc_password = masteruser-secret

   :ref:`Mail user variables <variables-mail_user>` can be used.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_max_idle_time
   :default: 29 mins
   :values: @time

   Send a command to the source IMAP server as a keepalive after no other
   command has been sent for this amount of time.

   Dovecot will send either ``NOOP`` or ``DONE`` to the source IMAP server.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_max_line_length
   :default: 0
   :values: @size

   The maximum line length to accept from the remote IMAP server.

   This setting is used to limit maximum memory usage.

   A value of ``0`` indicates no maximum.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_password
   :seealso: @imapc_master_user;dovecot_core, @imapc_user;dovecot_core
   :values: @string

   The authentication password for the remote IMAP server.

   If using master users, this setting will be the password of the master user.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_port
   :default: 143
   :values: @uint

   The port on the remote IMAP host to connect to.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_rawlog_dir
   :seealso: @debugging_rawlog
   :values: @string

   Log all IMAP traffic input/output to this directory.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_sasl_mechanisms
   :default: plain
   :values: @string

   The :ref:`sasl` mechanisms to use for authentication when connection to a
   remote IMAP server.

   The first one advertised by the remote IMAP sever is used.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     imapc_sasl_mechanisms = external plain login


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_ssl
   :default: no
   :values: no, imaps, starttls

   Use TLS to connect to the remote IMAP server.

   ============= =====================================================
   Value         Description
   ============= =====================================================
   ``no``        No TLS
   ``imaps``     Explicitly connect to remote IMAP port using TLS
   ``starttls``  Use IMAP STARTTLS command to switch to TLS connection
   ============= =====================================================


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_ssl_verify
   :default: yes
   :seealso: @imapc_ssl;dovecot_core
   :values: @boolean

   Verify remote IMAP TLS certificate?

   Verification may be disabled during testing, but should be enabled during
   production use.

   Only used if :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_ssl` is enabled.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_user
   :seealso: @imapc_master_user;dovecot_core, @imapc_password;dovecot_core
   :values: @string

   The user identity to be used for performing a regular IMAP LOGIN to the
   source IMAP server.

   :ref:`Mail user variables <variables-mail_user>` can be used.


Usage Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do a regular IMAP LOGIN, using STARTTLS, to imap.example.com:

.. code-block:: none

  imapc_host = imap.example.com
  imapc_password = secret
  imapc_port = 143
  imapc_ssl = starttls
  imapc_user = user@example.com


Quota
^^^^^

Using the ``imapc`` quota backend allows asking for the quota from remote
IMAP server (v2.2.30+). By default it uses ``GETQUOTAROOT INBOX`` to
retrieve the quota.

There are two parameters that can be used to control how the quota is looked
up:

* ``box = <mailbox>``: Use ``GETQUOTAROOT <mailbox>``
* ``root = <name>``: Use ``GETQUOTA <name>``

Example:

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    quota = imapc:root=User Quota
  }
