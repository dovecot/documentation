be enabled.

**Features**

=================================== ===============================================================================
Name                                Description
=================================== ===============================================================================
``acl``                             When this feature is enabled and the imap-acl plugin is loaded, using a remote
                                    location via imapc will make IMAP ACL commands (MYRIGHTS, GETACL, SETACL,
                                    DELETEACL) proxied to the remote.

                                    .. versionadded:: 2.3.15
``delay-login``                     Don't connect to the remote server until some command requires it. By default
                                    the server is connected to immediately on login.

                                    .. versionadded:: v2.2.29
``gmail-migration``                 Enable GMail-specific migration. Use IMAP ``X-GM-MSGID`` as POP3 UIDL. Add
                                    ``$GMailHaveLabels`` keyword to mails that have ``X-GM-LABELS`` except for
                                    ``\Muted`` keyword (to be used for migrating only archived emails in ``All
                                    Mails``). Add :dovecot_core:ref:`pop3_deleted_flag` to mails that don't exist
                                    in POP3 server.
``modseq``                          Access ``MODSEQ`` and ``HIGHESTMODSEQ``

                                    .. versionadded:: 2.2.24
``proxyauth``                       Use Sun/Oracle IMAP-server specific ``PROXYAUTH`` command to do master user
                                    authentication. Normally this would be done using the SASL PLAIN
                                    authentication.
``throttle:<INIT>:<MAX>:<SHRINK>``  When receiving [THROTTLED] response (from GMail), throttling is applied.
                                    **INIT** = initial throttling msecs (default: 50 ms), afterwards each
                                    subsequent [THROTTLED] doubles the throttling until **MAX** is reached
                                    (default: 16000 ms). When [THROTTLED] is not received for a while, it's shrank
                                    again. The initial shrinking is done after **SHRINK** (default: 500 ms). If
                                    [THROTTLED] is received again within this timeout, it's doubled, otherwise
                                    both throttling and the next shrinking timeout is shrank to 3/4 the previous
                                    value.

**Optimizations**

======================== ===================================================
Name                     Description
======================== ===================================================
``fetch-bodystructure``  Allow fetching ``BODY`` and ``BODYSTRUCTURE``
                         ``FETCH BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (..)]``.
``fetch-headers``        Allow fetching specific message headers from remote
                         server.
                        
                         .. versionadded:: 2.2.30
``rfc822.size``          Allow passing through message sizes using
                         ``FETCH RFC822.SIZE``.
``search``               Allow using ``SEARCH`` command.
======================== ===================================================

**Workarounds**

=========================== ===============================================================================
Name                        Description
=========================== ===============================================================================
``fetch-fix-broken-mails``  If a ``FETCH`` returns ``NO`` (but not ``NO [LIMIT]`` or ``NO [SERVERBUG]``),
                            assume the mail is broken in server and just treat it as if it were an empty
                            email. NOTE: This is often a dangerous option! It's not safe to assume that
                            ``NO`` means a permanent error rather than a temporary error. This feature
                            should be enabled only for specific users who have been determined to be
                            broken.
``fetch-msn-workarounds``   Try to ignore wrong message sequence numbers in ``FETCH`` replies whenever
                            possible, preferring to use the returned UID number instead.
``no-examine``              Use ``SELECT`` instead of ``EXAMINE`` even when we don't want to modify
                            anything in the mailbox. This is a Courier-workaround where it didn't
                            permanently assign ``UIDVALIDITY`` to an ``EXAMINEd`` mailbox, but assigned
                            it for ``SELECTed`` mailbox.
``zimbra-workarounds``      Fetch full message using ``BODY.PEEK[HEADER] BODY.PEEK[TEXT]`` instead of
                            just ``BODY.PEEK[]`` because the header differs between these two when there
                            are illegal control chars or 8bit chars. This mainly caused problems with
                            dsync, but as of v2.2.22+ this should no longer be a problem and there's
                            probably no need to enable this workaround.
=========================== ===============================================================================


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_host
   :values: @string

The remote IMAP host to connect to.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_list_prefix
   :values: @string

Access only mailboxes under this prefix.

Example, for a source IMAP server that uses an INBOX namespace prefix:

.. code-block:: none

  imapc_list_prefix = INBOX/


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_master_user
   :values: @string

The master username to authenticate as on the remote IMAP host.

To authenticate as a master user but use a separate login user, the
following configuration should be employed, where the credentials are
represented by masteruser and masteruser-secret:

.. code-block:: none

  imapc_user = %u
  imapc_master_user = masteruser
  imapc_password = masteruser-secret

:ref:`Mail user variables <variables-mail_user>` can be used.

.. seealso::

   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_password`.
   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_user`.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_max_idle_time
   :default: 29 mins
   :values: @time

Send a command to the source IMAP server as a keepalive after no other command
has been sent for this amount of time.

Dovecot will send either ``NOOP`` or ``DONE`` to the source IMAP server.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_max_line_length
   :default: 0
   :values: @size

The maximum line length to accept from the remote IMAP server.

This setting is used to limit maximum memory usage.

A value of ``0`` indicates no maximum.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_password
   :values: @string

The authentication password for the remote IMAP server.

If using master users, this setting will be the password of the master user.

.. seealso::

   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_master_user`.
   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_user`.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_port
   :default: 143
   :values: @uint

The port on the remote IMAP host to connect to.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_rawlog_dir
   :values: @string

Log all IMAP traffic input/output to this directory.

See: :ref:`debugging_rawlog`.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_sasl_mechanisms
   :default: plain
   :values: @string

The :ref:`sasl` mechanisms to use for authentication when connection to a
remote IMAP server.

The first one advertised by the remote IMAP sever is used.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

  imapc_sasl_mechanisms = external plain login


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_ssl
   :default: no
   :values: no, imaps, starttls

Use TLS to connect to the remote IMAP server.

Settings:
* ``no``: No TLS
* ``imaps``: Explicitly connect to remote IMAP port using TLS
* ``starttls``: Use IMAP STARTTLS command to switch to TLS connection


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_ssl_verify
   :default: yes
   :values: @boolean

Verify remote IMAP TLS certificate?

Verification may be disabled during testing, but should be enabled during
production use.

Only used if :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_ssl` is enabled.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: imapc_user
   :values: @string

The user identity to be used for performing a regular IMAP LOGIN to the
source IMAP server.

:ref:`Mail user variables <variables-mail_user>` can be used.

.. seealso::

   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_master_user`.
   * :dovecot_core:ref:`imapc_password`.


Usage Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do a regular IMAP LOGIN, using STARTTLS, to imap.example.com:

.. code-block:: none

  imapc_host = imap.example.com
  imapc_password = secret
  imapc_port = 143
  imapc_ssl = starttls
  imapc_user = user@example.com


Quota
^^^^^

Using the ``imapc`` quota backend allows asking for the quota from remote
IMAP server (v2.2.30+). By default it uses ``GETQUOTAROOT INBOX`` to
retrieve the quota.

There are two parameters that can be used to control how the quota is looked
up:

* ``box = <mailbox>``: Use ``GETQUOTAROOT <mailbox>``
* ``root = <name>``: Use ``GETQUOTA <name>``

Example:

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    quota = imapc:root=User Quota
  }
