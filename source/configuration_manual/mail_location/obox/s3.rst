S3-compatible Storages
======================

This document covers the S3 compatible storage services. In case you want to
use AWS S3 please also refer to :ref:`amazon_s3`.

.. code-block:: none

   plugin {
     # Basic configuration:
     obox_fs = s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@s3.example.com/?parameters
   }

The parameters are:

+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter               | Description                                        |
+=========================+====================================================+
| See :ref:`http_storages` for common parameters                               |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| region                  | Specify region name for AWS S3 bucket. When this   |
|                         | is specified, Dovecot starts using v4 signatures.  |
|                         | (The default is to use v2 signatures.)             |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| auth_role               | Perform AWS IAM lookup using this role name. See   |
|                         | :ref:`amazon_s3` for details.                      |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| auth_host               | IAM hostname and port. The default is              |
|                         | 169.254.169.254:80. Normally there is no reason to |
|                         | change this. This is mainly intended for testing.  |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

Bucket name
-----------

There are two ways to specify the bucket name:

 * path-style: S3 requests' path begins with the bucket parameter. This is
   configured with the bucket parameter. For example:
   ``https://s3.example.com/?bucket=BUCKETNAME`` will result in requests looking
   like ``https://s3.example.com/BUCKETNAME/object-path``
 * virtual-hosted-style: The first subdomain in the URL specifies the bucket.
   AWS supports only this style for new buckets. For example
   For example ``https://BUCKETNAME.s3.example.com``

Example configuration
---------------------

Below is the configuration for a generic S3 storage. See :ref:`amazon_s3` for
AWS S3 specific example configurations.

.. code-block:: none

   mail_location = obox:%8Mu/%u:INDEX=~/:CONTROL=~/
   plugin {
     obox_fs = fscache:1G:/var/cache/mails:compress:gz:6:s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@s3.example.com/?bucket=mails
     obox_index_fs = compress:gz:6:s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@s3.example.com/?bucket=mails
     fts_dovecot_fs = fts-cache:fscache:1G:/var/cache/fts:compress:gz:6:s3:https://s3.example.com/%8Mu/%u/fts/?bucket=mails
     obox_max_parallel_deletes = 1000
   }

We'll use the first 8 characters of the hex representation of the MD5 hash of
the username at the beginning of each object path. This is called *dispersion
prefix* and is used by (at least) AWS S3 and GCS S3 to internally perform
sharding and allow disk IO to scale.

S3 storage requirements
-----------------------

It's important that the S3 storage has an efficient way to list objects with
a given prefix. Copying performance is also important. Many S3 storages either
don't implement the listing at all, or it's only used for disaster recovery
type of purposes to list all objects. If this is the case, you can still use
the storage together with :ref:`dictmap_configuration`. See especially the
``storage-objectid-prefix`` and ``storage-passthrough-paths`` parameters.

Google Cloud Storage
--------------------

GCS is similar to AWS in that a "dispersion prefix" is required to properly
shard among the Google Cloud storage nodes. Google has provided verification
that 6 characters of dispersion prefix is "enough distribution to ensure access
to pretty massive resources on our side without gymnastics on our end."

Deleting multiple objects per request
-------------------------------------

  .. versionadded:: 2.3.10

The S3 drivers support bulk-delete requests. The ``bulk-delete`` option is
enabled by default to delete up to 1000 keys with one request. To change this
behaviour refer to ``bulk_delete_limit`` at :ref:`http_storages`. To actually
delete that many mails in a single request, you must also set
:ref:`plugin-obox-setting_obox_max_parallel_deletes`:

.. code-block:: none

     obox_max_parallel_deletes = 1000

This value should be the same as ``bulk_delete_limit`` or lower.
