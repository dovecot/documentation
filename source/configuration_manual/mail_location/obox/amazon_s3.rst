  mail_location = obox:%8{md5;format=hex:user}/%u:INDEX=~/:CONTROL=~/

We'll use the first 8 characters of the hex representation of the MD5 hash of
the username at the beginning of each object path. This is S3's ``dispersion
prefix`` which identifies which internal shard the data is stored in.

In AWS, by default, the sharding prefix is ignored for a bucket and it can be
enabled per request to AWS support.

.. Note:: The AWS sharding prefix is limited to hex characters \[0-9a-f] only.

When a S3 bucket is created, AWS creates a single shared partition for the
bucket with a default limit of 3,500 TPS for ``PUTs/DELETEs/POSTs`` ยง and 5500
GET requests per second (source).

This 3,500 TPS limit is generally too small and quickly surpassed by Dovecot
which results in a spike of ``503: Slow Down`` log events. It is strongly
recommended to contact AWS to request they manually set up 1 layer of hex
partitioning (``0-9a-f``),  to create16 dedicated partitions for your bucket.

``1 hex`` layer of partitioning thus means a theoretical capacity of 56,000
PUT/POST/DELETE and 88,000 GETs per second.

Per ``AWS``, you can go pretty deep in the number of layers, but most customers
do not need more than 2 layers of partitioning, (2 layers = 16x16 = 256
partitions = this would theoretically provide you up to: ``~896,000
PUT/POST/DELETE TPS and 1,408,000`` GET TPS if requests are distributed evenly
across the partitions).

  plugin {
    obox_fs = fscache:1G:/var/cache/mails:compress:gz:6:s3: https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/
    obox_index_fs = compress:gz:6:s3: https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/
  }

Get ACCESSKEY and SECRET from `www.aws.amazon.com <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_
``-> My account -> Security credentials -> Access`` credentials. Create the
``BUCKETNAME`` from ``AWS Management Console -> S3 -> Create Bucket``.

If the ``ACCESSKEY`` or ``SECRET`` contains any special characters, they can be
%hex-encoded.

.. Note::

  dovecot.conf handles %variable expansion internally as well, so % needs to be
  escaped as %% and ':' needs to be escaped as %%3A.

S3 driver uses the ``AWS2`` signing method by default, but ``AWS4`` can be used
by adding the bucket region parameter to the S3 URL:

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    obox_index_fs = compress:gz:6:s3: https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@host/?bucket=BUCKETNAME&region=eu-central-1
  }

The s3 driver also supports the bulk-deletion. The bulk-delete is enabled by default to delete up to 1000 keys with one request. To change this behaviour refer to ``bulk_delete_limit`` at :ref:`http_based_object_storages`

  .. versionadded:: 2.3.10

.. Warning:: AWS instances are known to react badly when high packets per second network traffic is generated by e.g. DNS lookups. Please see :ref:`os_configuration_dns_lookups`.
