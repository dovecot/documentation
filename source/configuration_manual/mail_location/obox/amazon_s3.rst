Amazon S3
================

This document covers the Amazon Web Services S3 (Simple Storage Service). In
case you want to use another provider's S3 storage services, please refer to
:ref:`s3_storages`.

.. Warning:: AWS instances are known to react badly when high packets per second network traffic is generated by e.g. DNS lookups. Please see :ref:`os_configuration_dns_lookups`.

Partitioning/Layering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

  mail_location = obox:%8{md5;format=hex:user}/%u:INDEX=~/:CONTROL=~/

We'll use the first 8 characters of the hex representation of the MD5 hash of
the username at the beginning of each object path. This is S3's ``dispersion
prefix`` which identifies which internal shard the data is stored in.

In AWS, by default, the sharding prefix is ignored for a bucket and it can be
enabled per request to AWS support.

.. Note:: The AWS sharding prefix is limited to hex characters \[0-9a-f] only.

When a S3 bucket is created, AWS creates a single shared partition for the
bucket with a default limit of 3,500 TPS for ``PUTs/DELETEs/POSTs`` § and 5500
GET requests per second (source).

This 3,500 TPS limit is generally too small and quickly surpassed by Dovecot
which results in a spike of ``503: Slow Down`` log events. It is strongly
recommended to contact AWS to request they manually set up 1 layer of hex
partitioning (``0-9a-f``),  to create16 dedicated partitions for your bucket.

``1 hex`` layer of partitioning thus means a theoretical capacity of 56,000
PUT/POST/DELETE and 88,000 GETs per second.

Per ``AWS``, you can go pretty deep in the number of layers, but most customers
do not need more than 2 layers of partitioning, (2 layers = 16x16 = 256
partitions = this would theoretically provide you up to: ``~896,000
PUT/POST/DELETE TPS and 1,408,000`` GET TPS if requests are distributed evenly
across the partitions).

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    obox_fs = fscache:1G:/var/cache/mails:compress:gz:6:aws-s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/
    obox_index_fs = compress:gz:6:aws-s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/
  }

.. Note::
        If the version you are using does not support the ``aws-s3`` scheme,
        try using the more generic ``s3`` scheme.

        .. versionadded:: 2.3.10

Get ACCESSKEY and SECRET from `www.aws.amazon.com <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_
``-> My account -> Security credentials -> Access`` credentials. Create the
``BUCKETNAME`` from ``AWS Management Console -> S3 -> Create Bucket``.

If the ``ACCESSKEY`` or ``SECRET`` contains any special characters, they can be
%hex-encoded.

.. Note::

  dovecot.conf handles %variable expansion internally as well, so % needs to be
  escaped as %% and ':' needs to be escaped as %%3A.


AWS Signing v2 vs v4
""""""""""""""""""""

S3 driver uses the ``AWS2`` signing method by default, but ``AWS4`` can be used
by adding the bucket region parameter to the S3 URL:

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    obox_index_fs = compress:gz:6:aws-s3:https://ACCESSKEY:SECRET@BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/?region=eu-central-1
  }

``aws-s3`` scheme
"""""""""""""""""

If the ``aws-s3`` scheme is used Dovecot defaults to prepend the following URL
parameters, refer to :ref:`http_storages` for details. The same
setup can be achieved by using the ``s3`` scheme and adding the parameters
manually.

.. code-block:: none

  addhdrvar=x-amz-security-token:%{auth:token}&loghdr=x-amz-request-id&loghdr=x-amz-id-2

Configuring ``loghdr`` for ``x-amz-request-id`` and ``x-amz-id-2`` tells Dovecot to
include this information in any error, debug or warning message. This additional
information helps when Troubleshooting Amazon S3 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonResponseHeaders.html).
You can also add multiple other ``loghdr`` parameters if needed.

Debug Output Example:

.. code-block:: none

        doveadm(user): Debug: http-client: conn 1.2.3.4:443 [1]: Got 200 response for request [Req1: GET https://test-mails.s3-service.com/?prefix=user%2Fidx%2F]: OK (x-amz-request-id:AABBCC22BB7798869, x-amz-id-2:DeadBeefanXBapRucWGAD1+aWwYMfwmXydlI0mHSuh4ic/j8Ji7gicTsP7xpMQz1IR9eydzeVI=) (took 63 ms + 140 ms in queue)

The ``addhdrvar`` parameter with ``x-amz-security-token`` adds the ``%{auth:token}``
expanded variable's value to all HTTP requests if the value is defined. This
variable gets set by Dovecot internally in case AWS IAM is in use.

Configuration using AWS IAM
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Dovecot supports AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authenticating
requests to AWS S3 using the AWS EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), solely
version 2 of IMDS (IMDSv2) is supported.

Using IAM allows running Dovecot with S3 Storage while not keeping the
credentials in the configuration.

A requirement for using IMDSv2 is that Dovecot is running on an AWS EC2
instance, otherwise the IMDS will not be reachable. Additionally an IAM role
must be configured which allows trusted entities, EC2 in this case, to
assume that role. The role (for example ``s3access``) that will be assumed must
have the ``AmazonS3FullAccess`` policy attached.

The ``auth_role`` can be configured as a URL parameter which specifies the IAM
role to be assumed. If no ``auth_role`` is configured, no IAM lookup will be
done. The IAM requests are targeted by default to the IMDSv2 service in EC2
(``169.254.169.25:80``). It is possible to override this default by appending
``auth_host=NEWHOST:NEWPORT`` to the URL, this is mainly used for testing
purposes.

.. code-block:: none

  plugin {
    obox_fs = aws-s3:https://BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/?auth_role=s3access&region=eu-central-1
  }

When using IAM you must ensure that the ``fs-auth`` service has proper
permissions/owner. Configure the user for the fs-auth listener to be the same
as for the metacache listener (Example below assuming ``vmail``).

.. code-block:: none

        service fs-auth {
          unix_listener fs-auth {
           user = vmail
          }
        }

.. versionadded:: 2.3.10
