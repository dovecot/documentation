The details of how to create the Cassandra tables and the dict mappings that
need to be appended to ``dovecot-dict-cql.conf.ext`` are described in:

 * :ref:`dictmap_cassandra_objectid`
 * :ref:`dictmap_cassandra_path`

The following base tables are always needed by fs-dictmap:

 * user_index_objects
 * user_mailbox_index_objects
 * user_mailbox_objects
 * user_mailbox_buckets
 * user_fts_objects

For more Cassandra details, see:

 * :ref:`cassandra`
 * :ref:`cassandra_replication_factor`

.. _dictmap_cassandra_diff_table:

Optimize Index Diff & Self-bundle Updates
-----------------------------------------

Cassandra doesn't handle row deletions very efficiently. The more rows are
deleted, the larger number of tombstones and the longer it takes to do lookups
from the same partition.

Most of the deletions Dovecot does are index diff & self-bundle updates.

Each Dovecot Backend server always writes only a single such object per folder,
which allows storing them with (user, folder, host) primary key and updating
the rows on changes, instead of inserting & deleting the rows.

The fs-dictmap ``diff-table`` parameter enables this behavior.

Diff-table requires these additional tables to exist in Cassandra:

 * user_index_diff_objects
 * user_mailbox_index_diff_objects

.. _dictmap_cassandra_refcounting_table:

Reference Counting table
------------------------

Reference counting allows a single mail object to be stored in multiple
mailboxes, without the need to create a new copy of the message data in object
storage. There are two downsides to it though:

The fs-dictmap ``refcounting-table`` parameter enables this behavior.

 * It requires an additional large Cassandra table that keeps track of the
   references.
 * It requires listing objects in Cassandra to find out if we just deleted the
   last reference or not. Only on the last reference deletion we want to delete
   the actual object from object storage.

Reference counting requires an additional table:

 * user_mailbox_objects_reverse
