The details of how to create the Cassandra tables and the dict mappings that
need to be appended to ``dovecot-dict-cql.conf.ext`` are described in:

 * :ref:`dictmap_cassandra_objectid`
 * :ref:`dictmap_cassandra_path`

The following base tables are always needed by fs-dictmap:

 * user_index_objects
 * user_mailbox_index_objects
 * user_mailbox_objects
 * user_mailbox_buckets
 * user_fts_objects
