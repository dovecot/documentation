System Calls Optimization
=========================

The use of the TZ environment variable can dramatically reduce the number
of system calls and kernel context switches performed by the application.

The ``localtime()`` function in glibc checks whether the ``TZ`` environment
variable is set. If it is not set, then glibc will use the ``stat()`` system
call every time ``localtime()`` is called, even with vDSO in place.

Setting the ``TZ`` environment variable to ``:/etc/localtime`` (or some other
timezone file of your choice) for a process will save glibc from making those
extra unnecessary system calls (Notice the column ``:`` prefix before the file
path).

The variable can be set either from the shell:

::

  export TZ=:/etc/localtime

or directly from inside the dovecot configuration file:

::

  import_environment = $import_environment TZ=:/etc/localtime

Note that a reload is not sufficient for the change to take effect. A restart
is required.
