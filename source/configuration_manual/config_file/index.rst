Dovecot Config File Syntax
==========================

 * :ref:`settings`
 * :ref:`settings_types`
 * :ref:`config_variables`

Example configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example configuration files are split into multiple files in ``conf.d/``
directory for grouping the settings. This is just for human readability though.
Dovecot doesn't care which settings are in which files. They could all be put
into a single ``dovecot.conf`` if preferred (except for
:ref:`external_config_files`).

Basic syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syntax generally looks like this:

.. code-block:: none

   # this is a comment

   settings_key = settings_value

The ``#`` character and everything after it are comments. Extra spaces and tabs
are ignored, so if you need to use these, put the value inside quotes. The
quote character inside a quoted string is escaped with ``\"``:

.. code-block:: none

   settings_key = "# char, \"quote\", and trailing whitespace  "

If Dovecot doesn't seem to be reading your configuration correctly, use `doveconf -n` to check how Dovecot actually parses it.

.. _named_filters:

Named Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. dovecotadded:: 2.4.0,3.0.0

Since Dovecot v2.4 all settings are globals. There are several filters which
can be used to restrict when the settings are used. There are "named filters"
and "named list filters".

Named filters are used to access settings in some specific situations. For
example:

.. code-block:: none

   mail_attribute {
     dict_driver = file
   }

In this case when mail attributes are being accessed, the dict settings are
looked up using the named filter called ``mail_attribute``. Note that named
filters cannot have a name before the ``{``, i.e. ``mail_attribute foo {``
will result in an error.

Setting names that begin with the same prefix as a named filter will be
treated as if they belong inside the named filter. For example all these
settings are equivalent and modify the exact same setting:

.. code-block:: none

   auth_policy_server_url = example.com
   auth_policy {
     server_url = example.com
     auth_policy_server_url = example.com
   }

Regardless of which method is used in ``dovecot.conf``, the ``doveconf``
output will be:

.. code-block:: none

   auth_policy {
     server_url = example.com
   }

Named list filters are similar to named filters, except there can be many of
them, each with a unique name. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   namespace inbox {
     prefix = INBOX/
   }
   namespace virtual {
     prefix = Virtual/
   }

Both named and named list filters can be updated later on in the configuration.
For example:

.. code-block:: none

   namespace inbox {
     prefix = INBOX/
   }
   # ...
   # possibly included from another file:
   namespace inbox {
      mailbox Trash {
        special_use = \Trash
      }
   }
   # The namespace settings get merged into the same inbox namespace filter.

The named list filter's name may also sometimes be used as part of the settings
instead of simply a name. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   service auth {
      unix_listener auth-master {
         # ..
      }
   }

Above the ``auth-master`` both uniquely identifies the filter name, but it also
acts as the ``unix_listener_path`` setting.

Settings inside filters are automatically attempted to be prefixed by the
filter prefix to avoid repetition. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   service imap {
      inet_listener imaps {
         ssl = yes
      }
   }

The ``ssl`` setting is attempted to be looked up in this order:

 * ``inet_listener_ssl``
 * ``service_ssl``
 * ``ssl``

The first setting that exists is used.

.. Note:: The filters must be currently written with the linefeeds as shown above.
	  So for example this doesn't work:

	  .. code-block:: none

	     namespace inbox { prefix = INBOX/ } # DOES NOT WORK


Connection Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few different connection/session related filters:

* protocol <name>: Name of the service/protocol that is reading the settings. For example: imap, pop3, doveadm, lmtp, lda

* remote <ip/network>: Remote client's IP/network. For non-TCP connections this will never match. For example 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.0/16.

* local_name <name>: Matches TLS connection's SNI name, if it's sent by the client. Commonly used to :ref:`configure multiple TLS certificates <dovecot_ssl_configuration>`.

* local <ip/range>: Locally connected IP/network. For non-TCP connections this will never match. For example 127.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.0/16.


These filters work for most of the settings, but most importantly auth settings currently only support the protocol filter. Some of the other settings are also global and can't be filtered, such as log_path.

An example, which uses all of the filters::

   local 127.0.0.1 {
      local_name imap.example.com {
         remote 10.0.0.0/24 {
            protocol imap {
               # ...
            }
         }
      }
   }

The nesting of the filters must be exactly in that order or the config parsing will fail.

When applying the settings, the settings within the most-specific filters override the less-specific filter's settings, so the order of the filters in config file doesn't matter.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   local 127.0.0.2 {
      key = 127.0.0.2
   }
   local 127.0.0.0/24 {
      key = 127.0.0.0/24
   }
   local 127.0.0.1 {
      key = 127.0.0.1
   }
   # The order of the above blocks doesn't matter:
   # If local IP=127.0.0.1, key=127.0.0.1
   # If local IP=127.0.0.2, key=127.0.0.2
   # If local IP=127.0.0.3, key=127.0.0.0/24

Similarly remote local filters override remote filters, which override local_name filters, which override protocol filters. In some situations Dovecot may also return an error if it detects that the same setting is being ambiguously set by multiple matching filters.

Setting types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`settings_types` for which types of settings are supported by the
configuration. Note especially the :ref:`strlist` and :ref:`boollist` which
look similar to named filters.


Including config files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main dovecot.conf file can also include other config files:

.. code-block:: none

   !include local.conf
   !include /path/to/another.conf
   !include conf.d/*.conf

The paths are relative to the currently parsed config file's directory.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   # /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf:
   !include conf.d/imap.conf
   # /etc/dovecot/conf.d/imap.conf:
   !include imap2.conf
   # /etc/dovecot/conf.d/imap2.conf is being included

If any of the includes fail (e.g. file doesn't exist or permission denied), it results in an error. It's not an error if wildcards don't result in any matching files. To avoid these errors, you can use !include_try instead:

.. code-block:: none

   !include_try passwords.conf

Including a file preserves the context where it's included from.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   protocol imap {
     !include imap-settings.conf
   }

.. _external_config_files:

External config files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Due to historical reasons there are still some config files that are external to the main `dovecot.conf`, which are typically named `*.conf.ext`.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   passdb/userdb { args } for ldap/sql points to a dovecot-ldap.conf.ext and dovecot-sql.conf.ext.

   dict { .. } points to dovecot-dict-*.conf.ext

Although these external config files look similar to the main `dovecot.conf` file, they have quite a lot of differences in details. Their parsing is done with a completely different config parser, so things like `filters`, `$variables`, `!includes` and `<files` don't work.

The external config files are also not loaded by the config process at startup, but instead they're parsed whenever the value is being used. So the external passdb/userdb files are loaded by auth process at startup, while the dict config is loaded by dict process at startup.

Eventually these external config files will hopefully be removed.

Long lines
^^^^^^^^^^
It's possible to split the setting values into multiple lines. Unfortunately this was broken for a long time, so outside `*.conf.ext` files this works only in

.. dovecotadded:: 2.2.22

.. code-block:: none

   # This works in *.conf.ext files, but in the main dovecot.conf only with v2.2.22+:
   setting_key = \
   long \
   value
   # equivalent to: "long value"

All the whitespace between lines is converted to a single space regardless of how many spaces or tabs are at the beginning of the line or before the '\'. Even if there is zero whitespace a single space is added.

Reading value from file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's possible to read the value for a setting from a file:

.. code-block:: none

   key = </path/to/file

The value is read exactly as the entire contents of the file. This includes all the whitespace and newlines. The paths are relative to the currently parsed config file's directory, similar to how !include works. The file is read immediately whenever parsing the configuration file, so if it changes afterwards it requires a configuration reload to see the changes. This functionality is especially useful for reading SSL certificates and keys.

Variable expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's possible to refer to other earlier settings as ``$name``.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   key = value1
   key2 = $key value2
   # Equivalent to key2 = value1 value2

However, you must be careful with the ordering of these in the configuration
file, because the ``$variables`` are expanded immediately while parsing the
config file and they're not updated later.

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. dovecotadded:: 2.3.14

It is possible use ``$ENV:name`` to expand values from environment.
Expansion only works when it's surrounded by spaces, and is not inside ``"quotes"`` or ``'quotes'``.
Note that these are also Case Sensitive.
These can also be used for external config files, but you need to list them in
:dovecot_core:ref:`import_environment` so that processes can see them.
