NFS
###

Dovecot is commonly used with NFS. However, Dovecot does **not** support
accessing the same user simultaneously by different servers. That will
result in more or less severe mailbox corruption. Note that this applies
to all mailbox access, including mail delivery.

* Use :ref:`dovecot_cluster_architecture` or assign users to specific backends
  in the proxy's passdb lookups.
* Use :ref:`lmtp_server` for mail deliveries.
* Set :dovecot_core:ref:`mmap_disable` = ``yes``
* Set :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_fsync` = ``always``
* Do **not** set :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_nfs_index` or
  :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_nfs_storage` (i.e. keep them as ``no``)
* Do **not** use the ``quota-status`` service.
* Unmounted NFS mount point directory should not be writable to Dovecot
  mail processes (i.e. often the ``vmail`` user). Otherwise if the NFS
  isn't mounted for some reason and user access mails, a new empty user
  mail directory is created, which breaks things.

NFS mount options
=================

* ``actimeo``: This or the more specific settings can be used to control NFS
  caching. Increasing this can reduce NFS traffic. It should be at least
  60 seconds (``actimeo=60``).

* ``nordirplus``: Disable readdirplus operations, which aren't needed by
  Dovecot. They can also slow down some NFS servers.

* ``noatime``: Disable updating atime. Dovecot doesn't need this and it may
  slow down NFS servers.

* ``root_squash``: Dovecot doesn't care about this. Typically Dovecot doesn't
  store any root-owned files in NFS.

* ``nolock`` / ``local_lock=all``: This is possible to use as a slightly
  unsafe optimization. All file locking is handled only locally instead of via
  NFS server. Assuming users are never accessed simultaneously by multiple backends, there is no need to use
  locking across NFS. Each user only locks their own files, and the user should
  only be accessed by a single server at a time. Unfortunately, this doesn't
  work 100% of the time so in some rare situations the same user can become
  accessed by multiple servers simultaneously. In those situations the mails
  are more likely to become corrupted if ``nolock`` is used. However, if
  indexes and emails are on different mountpoints, email corruption shouldn't
  be possible if the ``nolock`` is enabled only for the index mountpoint.
  This can still increase the likelihood of index corruption (which can lose
  message flags), but locking won't prevent index corruption completely anyway.

Optimizations
=============

Potential optimizations to use:

* mdbox format is likely more efficient to use than the sdbox format. The
  downside is that it requires running periodic ``doveadm purge`` for each
  user. Theses commands should be run via a doveadm proxy so they are run
  in the proper backends.
* Use :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_volatile_path` = ``/dev/shm/dovecot/%2.256Nu/%u`` to
  store some temporary files (e.g. lock files) in tmpfs rather than NFS.
* Use :dovecot_core:ref:`mailbox_list_index_prefix` = ``/dev/shm/dovecot/%2.256Nu/%u/dovecot.list.index``
  to store mailbox list indexes in tmpfs rather than NFS. This makes moving
  the users between backends more expensive though. It also needs a way to
  delete the list indexes for users that have already moved to different
  backends. This can be done with :ref:`nfs_hostchange`.
* Use :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_index_path` = ``/fast/%2.256Nu/%u`` to use
  "smaller fast storage" for index files and "larger slow storage" for mail
  files. Also use :dovecot_core:ref:`mailbox_list_iter_from_index_dir` = yes
  to list mailboxes via the fast index storage rather than the slow mail
  storage.
* Use :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_alt_path` = /slow/%2.256Nu/%u`` to use
  "smaller fast storage" for new mails and "larger slow storage" for old
  mails. The ``doveadm altmove`` command needs to be run periodically. Also use
  :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_alt_check` = no to disable a sanity check to make sure
  alt storage path doesn't unexpectedly change.
* See the NFS mount options above.

Clock synchronization
=====================

Run ntpd in the NFS server and all the NFS clients to make sure their
clocks are synchronized. If the clocks are more than one second apart
from each others and multiple computers access the same mailbox
simultaneously, you may get errors.

Clustering without user stickiness
==================================

Some people are using Dovecot in a cluster without assigning users to specific backends.
Below are some suggestions for improving the reliability of this
configuration.

.. warning:: This method is almost guaranteed to give random errors and can
             potentially lose emails.

* Configure load balancer so that connections from the same source IP are
  redirected to the same Dovecot server. This way a single client using
  multiple IMAP connections doesn't immediately cause problems.

* Set :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_nfs_index` = ``yes`` and
  :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_nfs_storage` = ``yes``. These will attempt to flush
  the NFS caches at appropriate times. However, it doesn't work perfectly.

    * Disabling NFS attribute cache helps a lot in getting rid of caching
      related errors, but this makes performance MUCH worse and increases
      the load on NFS server. This can usually be done by giving ``actimeo=0``
      or ``noac`` mount option.

* Make sure NFS lockd works properly. If it doesn't, use
  :dovecot_core:ref:`lock_method` = ``dotlock``. However, this degrades
  performance.

* Use Maildir mailbox format instead of sdbox/mdbox. Maildir is much more
  resistant to corruption.

    * Deliver mails in a way that it doesn't update Dovecot index files.
      Either don't use Dovecot LDA/LMTP, or configure it to use in-memory
      index files::

          protocol lda {
            mail_driver = maildir
	    mail_path = ~/Maildir
	    mail_index_path = MEMORY
          }
