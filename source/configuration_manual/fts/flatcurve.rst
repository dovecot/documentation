.. _fts_backend_flatcurve:

Flatcurve FTS Engine
====================

.. versionadded:: 2.4.0

Requires Xapian 1.4+ `<https://xapian.org/download/>`_ to work properly.

This is a Dovecot FTS plugin to enable message indexing using the
[Xapian](https://xapian.org/) Open Source Search Engine Library.

The plugin relies on Dovecot to do the necessary stemming. It is intended
to act as a simple interface to the Xapian storage/search query
functionality.

This driver supports match scoring and substring matches (on by default),
which means it is RFC 3501 (IMAP4rev1) compliant. This driver does not
support fuzzy searches.

The driver passes all of the ImapTest search tests.
`<https://imapwiki.org/ImapTest>`_

Enabling flatcurve is designed to be as easy as adding these lines:

.. code-block:: none

    mail_plugins = $mail_plugins fts fts_flatcurve
    plugin {
        fts = flatcurve
    }

Optional parameters
-------------------

.. note:: The default settings should be fine in most scenarios.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_commit_limit
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 500
  :values: @uint, !set to 0 to use the Xapian default

  Commit database changes after this many documents are updated. Higher commit
  limits will result in faster indexing for large transactions (i.e. indexing
  a large mailbox) at the expense of high memory usage. The default value
  should be sufficient to allow indexing in a 256 MB maximum size process.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_max_term_size
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 30
  :values: @uint, !max: 200

  The maximum number of characters in a term to index.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_min_term_size
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 2
  :values: @uint

  The minimum number of characters in a term to index.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_optimize_limit
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 10
  :values: @uint, !set to 0 to disable

  Once the database reaches this number of shards, automatically optimize the
  DB at shutdown.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_rotate_count
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 5000
  :values: @uint, !set to 0 to disable rotation

  When the "current" fts database reaches this number of messages, it is
  rotated to a read-only database and replaced by a new write DB. Most people
  should not change this setting.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_rotate_time
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: 5000
  :values: @time_msecs, !set to 0 to disable rotation

  When the "current" fts database exceeds this length of time (in msecs) to
  commit changes, it is rotated to a read-only database and replaced by a new
  write DB. Most people should not change this setting.

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_flatcurve_substring_search
  :plugin: fts-flatcurve
  :default: no
  :values: @boolean

  If enabled, allows substring searches (RFC 3501 compliant). However, this
  requires significant additional storage space. Most users today expect
  "Google-like" behavior, which is prefix searching, so substring searching is
  arguably not the modern expected behavior anyway. Therefore, even though it
  is not strictly RFC compliant, prefix (non-substring) searching is enabled
  by default.

FTS-Flatcurve Plugin Settings Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

    mail_plugins = $mail_plugins fts fts_flatcurve
    plugin {
        fts = flatcurve
        # All of these are optional, and indicate the default values.
        # They are listed here for documentation purposes; most people should
        # not need to define/override in their config.
        fts_flatcurve_commit_limit = 500
        fts_flatcurve_max_term_size = 30
        fts_flatcurve_min_term_size = 2
        fts_flatcurve_optimize_limit = 10
        fts_flatcurve_rotate_count = 5000
        fts_flatcurve_rotate_time = 5000
        fts_flatcurve_substring_search = no
    }

Data Storage
------------

Xapian search data is stored separately for each mailbox.

The data is stored under a 'fts-flatcurve' directory in the Dovecot index
file location for the mailbox.  The Xapian library is responsible for all
data stored in that directory - no Dovecot code directly writes to any file.

Logging/Events
--------------

This plugin emits with category `fts-flatcurve`, a child of the category `fts`
(see :ref`event_design`).
