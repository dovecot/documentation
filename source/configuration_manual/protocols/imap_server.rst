==========================
Dovecot as an IMAP server
==========================

Dovecot was optimized since the beginning to work as an efficient IMAP server.
`Dovecot supports a lot of IMAP extensions <https://imapwiki.org/Specs>`_.

Some of the extensions need to be explicitly enabled:

* METADATA
* COMPRESS
* SEARCH=FUZZY
* SPECIAL-USE
* NOTIFY: Set mailbox_list_index=yes
* URLAUTH: Set imap_urlauth_host and mail_attribute_dict
