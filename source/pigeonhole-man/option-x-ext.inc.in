**-x**\ *extensions*
   Set the available extensions. The parameter is a space-separated list
   of the active extensions. By prepending the extension identifiers
   with **+** or **-**, extensions can be included or excluded relative
   to the configured set of active extensions. If no extensions have a
   **+** or **-** prefix, only those extensions that are explicitly
   listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions are ignored and a warning
   is produced.

   For example **-x** "+editheader -enotify" will enable the editheader
   extension and disable the enotify extension. The rest of the active
   extensions depends on the :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_extensions` and
   :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_global_extensions` settings. By default, i.e. when
   :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_extensions` and :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_global_extensions` remain unconfigured,
   all supported extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions, security-sensitive extensions,
   extensions that require explicit configuration, and those that are still under development.
