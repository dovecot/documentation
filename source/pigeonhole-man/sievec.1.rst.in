NAME

sievec - Pigeonhole's Sieve script compiler

SYNOPSIS
========

**sievec** [*options*] *script-file* [*out-file*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **sievec** command is part of the Pigeonhole Project (:man:`pigeonhole(7)`),
which adds Sieve (:rfc:`5228`) and ManageSieve (:rfc:`5804`) support to the
Dovecot secure :ref:`IMAP <imap>` and :ref:`POP3 <pop3>` server (:man:`dovecot(1)`).

Using the **sievec** command, Sieve scripts can be compiled into a
binary representation. The resulting binary can be used directly to
process e-mail messages during the delivery process. The delivery of
mail messages and - by means of the LDA Sieve plugin - also the
execution of Sieve scripts is performed by Dovecot's local delivery
agent (LDA) called :man:`dovecot-lda(1)`. Usually, it is not necessary to
compile the Sieve script manually using **sievec**, because
:man`dovecot-lda(1)` will do this automatically if the binary is missing.
However, in some cases :man:`dovecot-lda(1)` does not have permission to write
the compiled binary to disk, forcing it to recompile the script every
time it is executed. Using the **sievec** tool, this can be performed
manually by an authorized user to increase performance.

The Pigeonhole Sieve implementation recognizes files with a **.sieve**
extension as Sieve scripts and corresponding files with a **.svbin**
extension as the associated compiled binary. This means for example that
Dovecot's LDA process will first look for a binary file "dovecot.svbin"
when it needs to execute "dovecot.sieve". It will compile a new binary
when it is missing or outdated.

The **sievec** command is also useful to verify Sieve scripts before
using. Additionally, with the **-d** option it can output a textual (and
thus human-readable) dump of the generated Sieve code to the specified
file. The output is then identical to what the :man:`sieve-dump(1)`
command produces for a stored binary file. This output is mainly useful
to find bugs in the compiler that yield corrupt binaries.

OPTIONS
=======

**-c**\ *config-file*
   Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.

**-d**
   Don't write the binary to *out-file*, but write a textual dump of the
   binary instead. In this context, the *out-file* value '-' has special
   meaning: it causes the the textual dump to be written to **stdout**.
   The *out-file* argument may also be omitted, which has the same
   effect as '-'. The output is identical to what the
   :man:`sieve-dump(1)` command produces for a compiled Sieve binary
   file. Note that this option is not allowed when the *out-file*
   argument is a directory.

**-D**
   Enable Sieve debugging.

.. include:: option-o.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc

.. include:: option-x-ext.inc

ARGUMENTS
=========

*script-file*
   Specifies the script to be compiled. If the *script-file* argument is
   a directory, all files in that directory with a *.sieve* extension
   are compiled into a corresponding *.svbin* binary file. The
   compilation is not halted upon errors; it attempts to compile as many
   scripts in the directory as possible. Note that the **-d** option and
   the *out-file* argument are not allowed when the *script-file*
   argument is a directory.

*out-file*
   Specifies where the (binary) output is to be written. This argument
   is optional. If this argument is omitted, a binary compiled from
   <scriptname>.sieve is saved as <scriptname>.svbin. If this argument
   is omitted and **-b** is specified, the binary dump is output to
   **stdout**.

EXIT STATUS
===========

**sievec** will exit with one of the following values:

**0**
   Compile was successful. (EX_OK, EXIT_SUCCESS)

**1**
   Operation failed. This is returned for almost all failures.
   (EXIT_FAILURE)

**64**
   Invalid parameter given. (EX_USAGE)

**67**
   User does not exist.

**68**
   Input file, address or other resource does not exist.

**73**
   Cannot create output file.

**77**
   Permission error.

**78**
   Configuration error.

**127**
   Unknown error.
