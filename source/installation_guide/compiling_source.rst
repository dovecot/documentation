Compiling Dovecot From Sources
==============================

.. todo:: Update this page

.. note::
    Dovecot is provided by package managers on most popular operating systems,
    and we also provide packages at `<https://repo.dovecot.org>`__, we encourage
    you to use these instead of building sources yourself.

For most people it is enough to do:

::

   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

That installs Dovecot under the ``/usr/local`` directory. The
configuration file is in ``/usr/local/etc/dovecot.conf``. Logging goes
to syslog's mail facility by default, which typically goes to
``/var/log/mail.log`` or something similar. If you are in a hurry, you
can then jump to :ref:`quick_configuration`.

If you have installed some libraries into locations which require
special include or library paths, you can pass them in the ``CPPFLAGS``
and ``LDFLAGS`` environment variables. For example:

::

   CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/openssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/openssl/lib" ./configure

You'll need to create two users for Dovecot's internal use:

**dovenull**
   Used by untrusted imap-login and pop3-login processes,
   :dovecot_core:ref:`default_login_user` setting.

**dovecot**
   Used by slightly more trusted Dovecot processes,
   :dovecot_core:ref:`default_internal_user` setting.

Both of them should also have their own **dovenull** and **dovecot**
groups. See :ref:`system_users_used_by_dovecot` for more information.

Compiling Dovecot From Git
==========================

If you got Dovecot from Git, for instance with

::

   git clone https://github.com/dovecot/core.git dovecot

you will first need to run ``./autogen.sh`` to generate the
``configure`` script and some other files. This requires that you have
the following software/packages installed:

-  ``wget``

-  ``autoconf``

-  ``automake``

-  ``libtool``

-  ``pkg-config``

-  ``gettext``

-  ``pandoc`` (not strictly required - you can avoid it by using:
   ``PANDOC=false ./configure``)

   .. dovecotremoved:: 3.0.0,2.4.0

-  GNU make.

It is advisable to add ``--enable-maintainer-mode`` to the ``configure``
script. Thus:

::

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
   make
   sudo make install

For later updates, you can use:

::

   git pull
   make 
   sudo make install

SSL/TLS Support
===============

Dovecot uses OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support and it should be automatically detected.
If it is not, you are missing some header files or libraries, or they
are just in a non-standard path. Make sure you have the ``openssl-dev``
or a similar package installed, and if it is not in the standard
location, set ``CPPFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` as shown in the first
section above.

By default the SSL certificate is read from
``/etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.pem`` and the private key from
``/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem``. The ``/etc/ssl`` directory can be
changed using the ``--with-ssldir=DIR`` configure option. Both can of
course be overridden from the configuration file.

You can use `Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator 
<https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=dovecot&version=2.3.16&config=modern&openssl=1.1.1k&guideline=5.7>`__
to get a decent SSL configuration.

Optional Configure Options
==========================

--help
   gives a full list of available options

--help=short
   list the dovecot specific options only and hide the generic configuration options

Options are usually listed as ``--with-something`` or
``--enable-something``. If you want to disable them, do it as
``--without-something`` or ``--disable-something``. There are many
default options that come from autoconf, automake or libtool. They are
explained elsewhere.

Here is a list of options that Dovecot adds. You should not usually have
to change these, these are usually not needed.

--enable-devel-checks
   Enables some extra sanity checks. This is mainly useful for
   developers. It does quite a lot of unnecessary work but should catch
   some programming mistakes more quickly.

--enable-asserts
   Enable assertion checks, enabled by default. Disabling them may
   slightly save some CPU, but if there are bugs they can cause more
   problems since they are not detected as early.

--without-shared-libs
   Link Dovecot binaries with static libraries instead of dynamic
   libraries.

--disable-largefile
   Specifies if we use 32bit or 64bit file offsets in 32bit CPUs. 64bit
   is the default if the system supports it (Linux and Solaris do).
   Dropping this to 32bit may save some memory, but it prevents
   accessing any file larger than 2 GB.

--with-mem-align=BYTES
   Specifies memory alignment used for memory allocations. It is needed
   with many non-x86 systems and it should speed up x86 systems too.
   Default is 8, to make sure 64bit memory accessing works.

--with-ioloop=IOLOOP
   Specifies what I/O loop method to use. Possibilities are ``select``,
   ``poll``, ``epoll`` and ``kqueue``. The default is to use the best
   method available on your system.

--with-notify=NOTIFY
   Specifies what file system notification method to use. Possibilities
   are ``dnotify``, ``inotify`` (both on Linux), ``kqueue`` (FreeBSD)
   and ``none``. The default is to use the best method available on your
   system. See `Notify method <#notify>`__ above for more information.

Generic features
----------------

--with-lua
  Enables Lua support for authentication and push notifications.

FTS options
-----------

--with-flatcurve
   Flatcurve full text search

   .. dovecotadded:: 3.0.0,2.4.0

--with-solr
   Build with Solr full text search support

Compression libraries
---------------------

--with-zlib
   Build with zlib compression support (default if detected)

--with-zstd
   Build with zStandard compression support (default if detected)


SQL Driver Options
------------------

SQL drivers are typically used for authentication, and they may be
used as a lib-dict backend too, which can be used by plugins for
different purposes.

--with-cassandra
   Build with cassandra support (requires ``cassandra-cpp-driver``)

--with-pgsql
   Build with PostgreSQL support (requires ``pgsql-devel``, ``libpq-dev`` or
   similar package)

--with-mysql
   Build with MySQL support (requires ``mysql-devel, ``libmysqlclient-dev``
   or similar package)

--with-sqlite
   Build with SQLite3 driver support (requires ``sqlite-devel``,
   ``libsqlite3-dev`` or similar package)

Authentication Backend Options
------------------------------

The basic backends are built if the system is detected to support them:

--with-pam
   Build with :ref:`PAM <authentication-pam>` support

--with-nss
   Build with :ref:`NSS <authentication-nss>`
   support

--with-bsdauth
   Build with :ref:`BSD authentication <authentication-bsdauth>`
   support (if supported by your OS)

Some backends require extra libraries and are not necessarily wanted, so
they are built only if specifically enabled:

--with-sql(=plugin)
   Build with generic SQL support (drivers are enabled separately, see above).
   You can also build this as a plugin.

--with-ldap(=plugin)
   Build with LDAP support (requires ``openldap-devel``, ``libldap2-dev`` or
   similar package). You can also build this as a plugin.

--with-gssapi(=plugin)
   Build with GSSAPI authentication support (requires ``krb5-devel``,
   ``libkrb5-dev`` or similar package)

Dynamic IMAP and POP3 Modules
=============================

The :dovecot_core:ref:`mail_plugins` setting lists all plugins that Dovecot is supposed
to load from the ``mail_plugin_dir`` directory at program start. These
plugins can do anything they want.

The plugin filename is prefixed with a number which specifies the order
in which the plugins are loaded. This is important if one plugin depends
on another.
