Upgrading between minor versions
********************************

The NEWS file contains all the important changes marked with ``*`` character.
Read them to see if there is anything that concerns you.
In general all the changes try to preserve backwards compatibility, but some changes which are meant to improve the stability and correctness of the configuration could mean breaking some existing installations.
And that may be a good thing, since it can expose problems which could otherwise show up as random errors.
