=========================
 Launchd plist file
=========================

This file is for Mac OS X 10.4 and later. For 10.3 and earlier StartupItems must be used.

Save it under /Library/LaunchDaemons/ with .plist extension (e.g. org.dovecot.dovecot.plist, following naming conventions of Apple and other vendors). Ownership should be root:wheel.

        <key>ServiceDescription</key>
        <string>Dovecot mail server</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>

If dovecot is not started as a foreground process, launchd will keep restarting it until the "No authentication sockets found" error message shows up in the logs and further logins are denied.
