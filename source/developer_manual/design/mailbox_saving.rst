Mailbox Saving
==============

Both saving and copying messages begins by calling
``mailbox_save_alloc()``. After that you can set message's metadata
fields:

``mailbox_save_set_flags()``
   Set flags and keywords.

``mailbox_save_set_received_date()``
   Set message's received date
   (IMAP INTERNALDATE). It also supports specifying timezone, but most
   backends don't support saving it.

``mailbox_save_set_from_envelope()``
   Set the envelope sender.
   Currently this is only used by mbox format to specify the address in
   From-line.

When copying, most of the metadata fields are automatically copied from
the source message. The only exception is message's flags and keywords.
If you want to preserve them, the easiest way is to call
``mailbox_save_copy_flags()``.

Some metadata fields are mainly useful when you're replicating or
restoring an existing mailbox and want to preserve metadata:

``mailbox_save_set_min_modseq()``
   Set message's modseq to at least
   the specified modseq. If the modseqs are already higher in the
   mailbox, the resulting modseq is what it would have been without this
   call.

``mailbox_save_set_uid()``
   Set message's UID. If mailbox's next_uid
   is already higher than the specified UID, the UID request is ignored.

``mailbox_save_set_guid()``
   Set message's globally unique ID. A new
   GUID is generated by default, and if there already exists a message
   with the same GUID a different one may or may not be given. For
   example with maildir the GUID is same as the base filename, while
   dbox has an explicit GUID metadata field.

``mailbox_save_set_pop3_uidl()``
   Set POP3 UIDL value. Not all backends support this.

``mailbox_save_set_save_date()``
   Set "message saved" date, i.e. the
   date/time when the message was saved to this mailbox. The default is
   the current time.

Once you're done with setting the metadata fields, you can either copy
an existing mail with ``mailbox_copy()`` or provide message body with:

``mailbox_save_begin()``
   Start saving from given input stream.

``mailbox_save_continue()``
   Save all data from input stream. If
   input stream is blocking, typically a single call to this function
   should be enough. If input stream is non-blocking, you need to call
   this function until you're done. In any case call this until
   ``i_stream_is_eof()`` returns TRUE.

``mailbox_save_finish()``
   Finish saving the mail, or:

``mailbox_save_cancel()``
   Abort saving the mail.

``mailbox_save_get_dest_mail()``
   Give access to the mail whose saving/copying
   was just finished (but not committed). You should be able to do pretty much
   anything with the mail, but its UID is usually 0 at this point.
