NAME
====

doveadm-who - Show who is logged into the Dovecot server

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [*GLOBAL OPTIONS*] **who** [**-1**] [**-f**
*passdb_field*] [**-a** *anvil_socket_path*] [*user_mask*]
[*ip* [**/** *bits*]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **who** command is used to show which users from which hosts are
currently connected to which service.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

This command uses by default the output formatter **table**.

OPTIONS
=======

**-1**
   Print one line per user and connection. Otherwise the connections are
   grouped by the username.

**-a** *anvil_socket_path*
   This option is used to specify an alternative socket. The option's
   argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or
   a hostname and port (*hostname*:*port*), in order to connect a remote
   host via a TCP socket.

   By default :man:`doveadm(1)` will use the socket *@rundir@/anvil*. The
   socket may be located in another directory, when the default *base_dir*
   setting was overridden in *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf*.

**-f** *passdb_field*
   Alternative username field to use for kicking, as returned by passdb.
   Only the passdb fields beginning with the *user\_* prefix are
   tracked.

ARGUMENTS
=========

*ip* [**/** *bits*]
   Specify an *ip* address or network range, in CIDR notation, to reduce
   the result to matching connections.

*user_mask*
   List only users whose login name matches the *user_mask*, or the
   alternative username (user\_\* field) if the **-f** parameter is used.
   It's also possible to use wildcards in the *user* name.

EXAMPLE
=======
