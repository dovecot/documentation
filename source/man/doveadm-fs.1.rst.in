NAME
====

doveadm-fs - Interact with the abstract mail storage filesystem

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] **fs** *command* [*ARGUMENTS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **doveadm fs** *commands* are used to abstractly interact with the
storage backend defined in the Dovecot configuration. It allows access
to the mailbox structure without needing to know details of how the
storage backend is designed.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

This command uses by default the **table** output formatter.

If you have multiple fs drivers, you start by having the first driver in
*fs-driver* and the rest of the pipeline as-is in *fs-args*.
