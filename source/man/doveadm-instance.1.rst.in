NAME
====

doveadm-instance - Manage the list of running Dovecot instances

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] **instance list**

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **instance remove** *name* | *base_dir*

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **doveadm instance** commands are used to manage the list of Dovecot
instances running on the server. In most installations there is only one
Dovecot instance, but in some cases is may be useful to have more (e.g.
running director proxy and backend in the same server).

Instances are added to the list automatically when Dovecot is started.
Each instance is uniquely identified by its *base_dir* setting.
Instances can be named by setting *instance_name* in each instance's
*dovecot.conf*. When an instance is named, it can be accessed easily by
giving **-i** *instance_name* command line parameter for Dovecot
binaries (e.g. doveadm).

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

ARGUMENTS

*base_dir*
   The base directory of a Dovecot instance.
