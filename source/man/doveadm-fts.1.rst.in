NAME
====

doveadm-fts - Manipulate the Full Text Search (FTS) index

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **fts** *command* [*OPTIONS*] [*ARGUMENTS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The doveadm fts *COMMANDS* can be used to manipulate the Full Text
Search (FTS) index.

.. include:: global-options.inc

This command uses by default the output formatter **flow** (without the *key* = prefix).

Command specific *options*:

.. include:: option-A.inc

.. include:: option-F-file.inc

.. include:: option-S-socket.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc


ARGUMENTS
=========

*namespace*
   The name of a namespace, e.g. the name of the shared namespace. When
   no namespace was given, the user's private namespace will be used.

COMMANDS
========

fts optimize
------------

**doveadm fts optimize** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [*namespace*]

Optimize the full text search index. This is also done automatically by
the full text search engines, but this enforces it to happen.

fts rescan
----------

**doveadm fts rescan** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [*namespace*]

Scan what mails exist in the full text search index and compare those to
what actually exist in mailboxes. This removes mails from the index that
have already been expunged and makes sure that the next **doveadm
index** will index all the missing mails (if any). Note that currently
most FTS backends do not implement this properly, but instead they
delete all the FTS indexes. This may change in the future versions.

.. include:: reporting-bugs.inc
