NAME
====

doveconf - Dovecot's configuration dumping utility

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveconf** [**-adnPNSx**] [**-c** *config-file*] [**-f** *filter*]

**doveconf** [**-n**] [**-c** *config-file*] *section_name* ...

**doveconf** [**-h**] [**-c** *config-file*] [**-f** *filter*] *setting_name* ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

**doveconf** reads and parses Dovecot's configuration files and converts
them into a simpler format used by the rest of Dovecot. All standalone
programs, such as :man:`dovecot(1)`, will first
get their settings by executing doveconf.

For system administrators, **doveconf** is mainly useful for dumping the
configuration in easy human readable output.

OPTIONS
=======

**-a**
   Show all settings with their currently configured values.

**-c** *config-file*
   read configuration from the given *config-file*. By default
   *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf* will be used.

**-d**
   Show the setting's default value instead of the one currently
   configured.

**-f** *filter*
   Show the matching configuration for the specified *filter*
   condition. The *filter* option string has to be given as
   *name* **=** *value* pair. For multiple filter conditions the
   **-f** option can be supplied multiple times.

   Possible names for the *filter* are:

   **lname**
      The local hostname, e.g. mail.example.com. This will only match
      hostnames which were configured like:

      **local_name mail.example.com { # special settings }**

   **local**
      The server's hostname or IP address. This will also match
      hostnames which were configured like:

      **local imap.example.net { # special settings }**

   **protocol, service**
      The protocol, e.g. imap or pop3

   **remote**
      The client's hostname or IP address.

**-h**
   Hide the setting's name, show only the setting's value.

**-n**
   Show only settings with non-default values.

**-N**
   Show settings with non-default values and explicitly set default
   values.

**-S**
   Dump settings in simplified machine parsable/readable format.

**-s**
   Show also hidden settings. The hidden settings should not be changed
   normally.

**-P**
   Show passwords and other sensitive values.

**-x**
   Expand configuration variables (e.g. ``$ENV:foo``) and show
   file contents (from e.g. ``ssl_key_password = </etc/ssl/password``).

*section_name*
   Show only the current configuration of one or more specified
   sections.

*setting_name*
   Show only the setting of one or more *setting_name* (s) with the
   currently configured value. You can show a setting inside a section
   using '/' as the section separator, e.g. service/imap/executable.

EXAMPLE
=======

When Dovecot was configured to use different settings for some
networks/subnets it is possible to show which settings will be applied
for a specific connection.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveconf -f local=10.0.0.110 -f remote=10.11.1.2 -f service=pop3 -n**

**doveconf** can be also used to convert v1.x configuration files into
v2.x format.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveconf -n -c /oldpath/dovecot.conf > @pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf.new**

This example shows how to ask **doveconf** for a global setting and a
protocol specific setting. The second command uses also the **-h**
option, in order to hide the setting's name.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveconf mail_plugins**
   mail_plugins = quota
   **doveconf -h -f protocol=imap mail_plugins**
   quota imap_quota

This example demonstrates how to dump a whole configuration section.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveconf dict**
   dict_legacy {
     quota_clone = pgsql:@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot-dict-sql.conf.ext
   }

Or how to dump only the quota dict:

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveconf dict/quota_clone**
   dict/quota_clone = pgsql:@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot-dict-sql.conf.ext

.. include:: reporting-bugs.inc
