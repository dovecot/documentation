**-A**
   If the **-A** option is present, the *command* will be performed for
   all users. Using this option in combination with system users from
   **userdb { driver = passwd }** is not recommended, because it
   contains also users with a lower UID than the one configured with the
   :dovecot_core:ref:`first_valid_uid` setting.

   When the SQL userdb module is used, make sure that the
   :dovecot_core:ref:`userdb_sql_iterate_query` setting matches your database
   layout. When using the LDAP userdb module, make sure that the
   *iterate_attrs* and *iterate_filter* settings in
   *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext* match your LDAP schema.
   Otherwise :man:`doveadm(1)` will be unable to iterate over all users.
