SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] **auth** *command* [*OPTIONS*] [*ARGUMENTS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **doveadm auth** *COMMANDS* can be used to perform various
authentication related actions.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

Command specific *options*:

.. include:: option-x.inc


ARGUMENTS
=========

*user*
   The *user*'s login name. Depending on the configuration, the login
   name may be for example **jane** or **john@example.com**.

*password*
   Optionally the user's password. :man:`doveadm(1)` will prompt for the
   password, if none was given.

COMMANDS
========

auth cache flush
----------------

**doveadm auth cache flush** [**-a** *master_socket_path*] [*user* ...]

Flush the authentication cache. By default the cache is flushed for all
the users (which can also be done by sending SIGHUP to the auth
process). You can also flush the cache for one or more users by
providing their usernames.

**-a** *master_socket_path*
   This option is used to specify an absolute path to an alternative
   UNIX domain socket.

   By default :man:`doveadm(1)` will use the socket *@rundir@/auth-master*.
   The socket may be located in another directory, when the default
   *base_dir* setting was overridden in *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf*.

.. include:: option-x.inc


auth lookup
-----------

**doveadm auth lookup** [**-a** *userdb_socket_path*] [**-x** *auth_info*] [**-f** *field*] *user* [...]

Similar to :man:`doveadm-user(1)` command, except it performs a *passdb*
lookup (without authentication) instead of a *userdb* lookup.

**-a** *userdb_socket_path*
   This option is used to specify an absolute path to an alternative
   UNIX domain socket.

   By default :man:`doveadm(1)` will use the socket *@rundir@/auth-userdb*.
   The socket may be located in another directory, when the default
   *base_dir* setting was overridden in *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf*.

**-f** *field*
   When this option and the name of a userdb field is given,
   :man:`doveadm(1)` will show only the value of the specified field.

.. include:: option-x.inc

auth test
---------

**doveadm auth test** [**-a** *auth_socket_path*] [**-x** *auth_info*] *user* [*password*]

Test authentication for the given user.

**-a** *auth_socket_path*
   This option is used to specify an absolute path to an alternative
   UNIX domain socket.

   By default :man:`doveadm(1)` will use the socket *@rundir@/auth-client*.
   The socket may be located in another directory, when the default
   *base_dir* setting was overridden in *@pkgsysconfdir@/dovecot.conf*.

.. include:: option-x.inc

EXAMPLE
=======

This example demonstrates an imap authentication test for user john,
assuming the user is connected from the host with the IP address
192.0.2.143.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveadm auth test -x service=imap -x rip=192.0.2.143 john**
   Password:
   passdb: john auth succeeded
   extra fields:
     user=john
