NAME
====

doveadm-dump - Dump the content of Dovecot's binary mailbox index/log

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **dump** [**-t** *type*] *path*

DESCRIPTION
===========

Dovecot uses several binary index and log files in order to improve
performance for accessing mails. For some mailbox formats, such as sdbox
and mdbox, the index files are part of the format itself. For details
about index files, see also:
https://doc.dovecot.org/developer_manual/design/indexes/mail_index_api/

**doveadm dump** is used to show the contents of those mailbox index/log
files, in human readable format. This is mainly useful for Dovecot
developers when debugging some problem.

.. include:: global-options.inc

Command specific *options*:

**-t** *type*
   the file type of the file to be dumped. If the *type* was omitted,
   :man:`doveadm(1)` tries to detect the type of *path*. *type* can be:

   **dbox**
      => m.\ *n* (sdbox or mdbox mailbox file)
