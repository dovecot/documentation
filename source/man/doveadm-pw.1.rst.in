NAME
====

doveadm-pw - Dovecot's password hash generator

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **pw -l**

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **pw** [**-p** *password*] [**-r** *rounds*] [**-s** *scheme*] [**-u** *user*] [**-V**]

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] **pw -t** *hash* [**-p** *password*] [**-u** *user*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**doveadm pw** is used to generate password hashes for different
password *scheme* s and optionally verify the generated hash.

All generated password hashes have a {*scheme*} prefix, for example
{**SHA512-CRYPT.HEX**}. All passdbs have a default scheme for passwords
stored without the {*scheme*} prefix. The default scheme can be
overridden by storing the password with the scheme prefix.

.. include:: global-options.inc

Command specific *options*:

**-l**
   List all supported password *scheme* s and exit successfully.

   There are up to three optional password *scheme*\ s: **BLF-CRYPT**
   (Blowfish crypt), **SHA256-CRYPT** and **SHA512-CRYPT**. Their
   availability depends on the system's currently used libc.

**-p** *password*
   The plain text *password* for which the hash should be generated. If
   no *password* was given :man:`doveadm(1)` will prompt interactively
   for one.

**-r** *rounds*
   The password *scheme* s **BLF-CRYPT**, **SHA256-CRYPT** and
   **SHA512-CRYPT** supports a variable number of encryption *rounds*.
   The following table shows the minimum/maximum number of encryption
   *rounds* per scheme. When the **-r** option was omitted the default
   number of encryption rounds will be applied.

::

    Scheme       | Minimum | Maximum   | Default
   ----------------------------------------------
    BLF-CRYPT    |       4 |        31 |       5
    SHA256-CRYPT |    1000 | 999999999 |    5000
    SHA512-CRYPT |    1000 | 999999999 |    5000


**-s** *scheme*
   The password *scheme* which should be used to generate the hashed
   password. By default the **CRYPT** *scheme* will be used (with the
   $2y$ bcrypt format). It is also possible to append an encoding
   suffix to the *scheme*. Supported encoding suffixes are: **.b64**,
   **.base64** and **.hex**.

   See also
   https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/password_schemes/
   for more details about password schemes.

**-t** *hash*
   Test if the given password *hash* matches a given plain text
   password. You should enclose the password *hash* in single quotes, if
   it contains one or more dollar signs (**$**). The plain text password
   may be passed using the **-p** option. When no password was
   specified, :man:`doveadm(1)` will prompt interactively for one.

**-u** *user*
   When the **DIGEST-MD5** *scheme* is used, also the *user* name must
   be given, because the user name is a part of the generated hash. For
   more information about Digest-MD5 please read also:
   https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/digest-md5/

**-V**
   When this option is given, the hashed password will be internally
   verified. The result of the verification will be shown after the
   hashed password, enclosed in parenthesis.

EXAMPLE
=======

The first password hash is a DIGEST-MD5 hash for jane.roe@example.com.
The second password hash is a CRAM-MD5 hash for john.doe@example.com.

   **doveadm pw -s digest-md5 -u jane.roe@example.com**
