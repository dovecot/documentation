SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] *mailbox_cmd* [*options*] [*arguments*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**doveadm mailbox** can be used to query and modify mailboxes.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

Command specific *options*:

.. include:: option-A.inc

.. include:: option-F-file.inc

.. include:: option-S-socket.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc

ARGUMENTS
=========

*mailbox*
   Is the name of a *mailbox*, as visible to IMAP clients, except in
   UTF-8 format. The hierarchy separator between a parent and child
   mailbox is commonly '**/**' or '**.**', but this depends on your
   selected mailbox storage format and namespace configuration. The
   mailbox names may also require a namespace prefix.

COMMANDS
========

mailbox create
--------------

**doveadm mailbox create** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-g** *guid*] [**-s**] *mailbox*...

This command is used to create one or more mailboxes. The mailbox format
of the created mailboxes depends on the *mail_location* setting, or the
user's *mail* field, returned by the userdb.

**-g** *guid*
   Create the mailbox with the specified GUID.

**-s**
   When this option was given, the created mailboxes will be also added
   to the user's subscriptions.

mailbox cryptokey
-----------------

**mailbox cryptokey export|generate|list|password**

This command is used to manage mail crypt plugin cryptographic keys.
Please see :man:`doveadm-mailbox-cryptokey(1)` for more details.

**doveadm mailbox delete** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-s**] [**-r**] [**-e**] [**-Z**] *mailbox*...

This command deletes a mailbox and expunges all the messages it
contains. If the mailbox has any children, they won't be deleted, unless
**-r** is given.

   Delete mailboxes recursively

**-s**
   Unsubscribe deleted mailboxes.

**-e**

   wrong. This option is mainly useful when deleting the entire user.

mailbox list
------------

**doveadm mailbox list** [**-7** | **-8**] [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-s**] [*mailbox* ...]

To get an overview of existing mailboxes use this command. It's also

The **mailbox mutf7** command may be used to convert the international
mailbox *name* into a modified version of the UTF-7 encoding and vice
versa. See RFC 3501, section 5.1.3 (Mailbox International Naming
Convention).

**-7**
   Indicates that the *name*'s string representation is mUTF-7 encoded
   and it should be converted to UTF-8.

**-8**
   Indicates that the *name*'s is UTF-8 encoded and should be converted
   to mUTF-7 (default).

*name*
   One or more mailbox names that should be converted.

mailbox rename
--------------

**doveadm mailbox rename** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-s**] *old_name* *new_name*

*mailbox* *...*

modification sequence values.

Usually this is only ever to be used during migration, or restoring
mailbox after disaster. Settings these values is highly discouraged, and
is not supported for all mail backends.

-------------------

**doveadm mailbox cache purge** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox* *...*

Purge the dovecot.index.cache file. Most importantly this frees up disk
space from mails that were already deleted. Normally there i no need to
run this command manually, because the compression is also run
automatically.

mailbox cache decision

**doveadm mailbox cache decision** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**--all**]
[**--fields** *list of fields*] [**--last-used** *unix timestamp*] [**--decision** *no|temp|yes*] *mailbox* *...*

This command is used to list or change caching decisions for field(s) in
mailbox(es). You can list decisions by leaving out decision and
last-used parameters.

**--all**
   List or change all fields.

**--fields**
   List or change these comma/space separated fields.

**--decision**
   Set field caching decision. Yes means it's always cached. Temp means
   it's provisionally cached. No means the field is not cached.

**--last-used**
   Set field's last used timestamp.

NOTE. This command cannot be used to add new fields to cache! You need
to first add them to configuration. Setting caching to no will not
immediately drop field from cache, it will stop adding the field to
cache.

mailbox cache remove
--------------------

**doveadm mailbox cache remove** [**-A** | **-u** *user* | **-F** *file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] *search query*

Remove any matching mail(s) from cache.

WARNING! This command can erase ALL cached data, causing system
slowness.

See :man:`doveadm-search-query(7)` for the search query syntax.

EXAMPLE
=======

List subscribed mailboxes, beginning with 'dovecot', of user bob.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveadm mailbox list -s -u bob dovecot\***
   dovecot
   dovecot/pigeonhole
   dovecot/pigeonhole/2.0

Now have a look at the status of user bob's dovecot mailboxes.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveadm -f table mailbox status -u bob "messages vsize" dovecot\***
   mailbox                                    messages vsize
   dovecot                                    20501    93968492

   dovecot/pigeonhole/2.0                     47       323474

Converting an internationalized mailbox name from mUTF-7 to UTF-8 and
vice versa.

.. parsed-literal::

   **doveadm mailbox mutf7 -7 "~peter/mail/&U,BTFw-/&ZeVnLIqe-"**
