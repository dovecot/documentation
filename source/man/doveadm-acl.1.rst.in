NAME
====

doveadm-acl - Manage Access Control List (ACL)

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] **acl** *command* [*OPTIONS*] [*ARGUMENTS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **doveadm acl** *COMMANDS* can be used to execute various Access
Control List related actions.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

This command uses by default the output formatter **table**.

OPTIONS
=======

.. include:: option-A.inc

.. include:: option-F-file.inc

.. include:: option-S-socket.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc

ARGUMENTS
=========

*id*
   The id (identifier) is one of:

   * **group-override** = *group_name*
   * **user** = *user_name*
   * **owner**
   * **group** = *group_name*
   * **authenticated**
   * **anyone**
   * **anonymous**, which is an alias for anyone

   The ACLs are processed in the precedence given above, so for
   example if you have given read-access to a group, you can still
   remove that from specific users inside the group.

   Group-override identifier allows you to override users' ACLs.
   Probably the most useful reason to do this is to temporarily
   disable access for some users. For example:

   ::

      user=timo rw
      group-override=tempdisabled

   Now if timo is a member of the tempdisabled group, he has no access
   to the mailbox. This wouldn't be possible with a normal group
   identifier, because the **user=timo** would override it.

*mailbox*
   The name of the mailbox, for which the ACL manipulation should be
   done. It's also possible to use the wildcard characters "*****"
   and/or "**?**" in the mailbox name.

*right*
   Dovecot ACL right name. This isn't the same as the IMAP ACL letters,
   which aren't currently supported. Here is a mapping of the IMAP ACL
   letters to Dovecot ACL names:

      **l -> lookup**
         *Mailbox* is visible in mailbox list. *Mailbox* can be
         subscribed to.

      **r -> read**
         *Mailbox* can be opened for reading.

      **w -> write**
         Message flags and keywords can be changed, except **\Seen**
         and **\Deleted**.

      **s -> write-seen**
         **\Seen** flag can be changed.

      **t -> write-deleted**
         **\Deleted** flag can be changed.

      **i -> insert**
         Messages can be written or copied to the *mailbox*.

      **p -> post**
         Messages can be posted to the *mailbox* by **dovecot-lda**,
         e.g. from Sieve scripts.

      **e -> expunge**
         Messages can be expunged.

      **k -> create**
          Mailboxes can be created/renamed directly under this
          *mailbox* (but not necessarily under its children, see *ACL
          Inheritance* at
          https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/acl/#acl-inheritance).
          Note: Renaming also requires the delete right.

      **x -> delete**
         *Mailbox* can be deleted.

      **a -> admin**
         Administration rights to the *mailbox* (currently: ability to
         change ACLs for *mailbox*).

COMMANDS
========

acl add
-------

**doveadm acl add** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox id* *right* [*right* ...]

Add ACL rights to the *mailbox*/*id*. If the *id* already exists, the
existing rights are preserved.

acl debug
---------

**doveadm acl debug** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox*

This command can be used to debug why a shared mailbox isn't accessible
to the user. It will list exactly what the problem is.

acl delete
----------

**doveadm acl delete** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox id*

Remove the whole ACL entry for the *mailbox*/*id*.

acl get
-------

**doveadm acl get** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] [**-m**] *mailbox*

Show all the ACLs for the *mailbox*.

acl recalc
----------

**doveadm acl recalc** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*]

Make sure the *user*'s shared mailboxes exist correctly in the
*acl_shared_dict*.

acl remove
----------

**doveadm acl remove** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox id* *right* [*right* ...]

Remove the specified ACL rights from the *mailbox*/*id*. If all rights
are removed, the entry still exists without any rights.

**doveadm acl rights** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
[**-S** *socket_path*] *mailbox*

Show the *user*'s current ACL rights for the *mailbox*.

acl set
-------

**doveadm acl set** [**-u** *user* | **-A** | **-F** *file*]
