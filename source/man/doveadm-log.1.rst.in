COMMANDS
========

log errors
----------

**doveadm log errors** [**-s** *min_timestamp*]

The **log errors** command is used to show the last - up to 1 000 -
errors and warnings. If no output is generated, no errors have occurred
since the last start.

**-s** *min_timestamp*
   An integer value, representing seconds since the epoch - also known
   as Unix timestamp. When a min_timestamp was given, :man:`doveadm(1)`
   will only show errors occurred since that point in time.

log find
--------

**doveadm log find** [*directory*]

The **log find** command is used to show the location of the log files,
to which :man:`dovecot(1)`
logs its messages through **syslogd** (8) and :man:`doveadm(1)` could
not find any log files, you can specify the *directory* where your
syslogd writes its log files.

log reopen
----------

**doveadm log reopen**

This command causes **doveadm** to send a SIGUSR1 signal to master
process, which causes it to reopen all log files configured in the
*log_path*, *info_log_path* and *debug_log_path* settings. These
settings are configured in *@pkgsysconfdir@/conf.d/10-logging.conf*.

The master process also signals the log process to do the same. This
is mainly useful after manually rotating the log files.

log test
--------

**doveadm log test**

This command causes **doveadm** to write the message "This is Dovecot's
*priority* log (*timestamp*)" to the configured log files. The used
priorities are: **debug**, **info**, **warning**, **error** and
**fatal**.
