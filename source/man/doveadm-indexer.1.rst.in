NAME

doveadm-indexer - Commands related to managing the indexer process

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] **indexer** *command* [*OPTIONS*] [*ARGUMENTS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**doveadm indexer** can be used to manage the indexer process.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc


COMMANDS
========

indexer add
-----------

**doveadm indexer add** [**-h**] [**-n** *max_recent*] *user* *mailbox*

Add indexing request for the given *user* and the *mailbox* to the
indexer queue. It works the same as the **doveadm index -q** command.

**-h**
   Add the indexing request to the head of the queue. By default the
   request is added to the tail of the queue.

**-n** *max_recent*
   An integer value, which specifies the maximum number of \\Recent
   messages in mailboxes. If the mailbox contains more than *max_recent*
   messages with \\Recent flag set, the mailbox will not be indexed.
   This may be useful to avoid unnecessary indexing for large mailboxes
   that are never opened.

indexer remove
--------------

**doveadm indexer remove** *user_mask*

Remove all indexer requests for the matching *user_mask*. It's possible
to use wildcards. Requests that are currently processed by
indexer-worker are not listed; use **doveadm kick** instead to kick
them.

indexer list
------------

**doveadm indexer list** *user_mask* [*mailbox_mask*]

List all the queued indexing requests matching the *user_mask* (and the
*mailbox_mask*). It's possible to use wildcards. Requests that are
currently processed by indexer-worker are not listed; use **doveadm who** instead to see them.
