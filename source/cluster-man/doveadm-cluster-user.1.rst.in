COMMANDS
========


cluster user access
-------------------

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] cluster user access [ **-u** *user* ] | [ **-A** ] | [ **-f** *file* ] [ **-i** ]

Perform cluster lookup for the user (or users). This command must be run from a backend, not a proxy.
For now this command is mainly used internally to finish user group moves. Displays the host name of the backend which
the user ended up.

You can use the ``-i`` parameter to display backend's IP rather than host name.

.. include:: option-F-file.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc


cluster user delete
-------------------

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] cluster user delete *user* [ *user* ... ]

Deletes a user record from GeoDB. Can be used on multiple users.


cluster user move
-----------------

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] cluster user move [ **-\-direct** ] [ **-\-site** *site* ] *user* *group* [ *failover group* ]
