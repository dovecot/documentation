Settings
^^^^^^^^

.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts
   :plugin: fts
   :values: @named_list_filter

   Configures the used fts driver to perform FTS indexing. If not specified,
   FTS is disabled. The filter name refers to the
   :dovecot_plugin:ref:`fts_driver` setting.

   Example::

     fts solr {
       [...]
     }


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_autoindex
   :default: no
   :plugin: fts
   :seealso: @fts_autoindex_exclude;dovecot_plugin, @fts_autoindex_max_recent_msgs;dovecot_plugin
   :values: @boolean

   If enabled, index mail as it is delivered or appended.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_autoindex_exclude
   :plugin: fts
   :seealso: @fts_autoindex;dovecot_plugin
   :values: @boolean

   You can disable autoindexing for a mailbox adding this flag:

   Example::

      mailbox trash {
        special_use = \Trash
        fts_autoindex_exclude = yes
      }

      mailbox spam {
        special_use = \Junk
        fts_autoindex_exclude = yes
      }

      mailbox storage/* {
        fts_autoindex_exclude = yes
      }


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_autoindex_max_recent_msgs
   :added: 2.2.9
   :default: 0
   :plugin: fts
   :seealso: @fts_autoindex;dovecot_plugin
   :values: @uint

   To exclude infrequently accessed mailboxes from automatic indexing, set
   this value to the maximum number of ``\Recent`` flagged messages that exist
   in the mailbox.

   A value of ``0`` means to ignore this setting.

   Mailboxes with more flagged ``\Recent`` messages than this value will not
   be autoindexed, even though they get deliveries or appends. This is useful
   for, e.g., inactive Junk folders.

   Any folders excluded from automatic indexing will still be indexed, if a
   search on them is performed.

   Example::

     fts_autoindex_max_recent_msgs = 999


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_decoder_driver
   :plugin: fts
   :values: script, tika

   Optional setting; if set, decode attachments to plaintext using
   the selected service and index the resulting plaintext.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_decoder_script_socket_path
   :added: 2.1.0
   :plugin: fts
   :values: @string

   (previously named ``fts_decoder``)
   Name of the script service used to decode the attachments.

   See the ``decode2text.sh`` script included in Dovecot for how to use this.

   Example::

     fts_decoder = script
     decoder_script_socket_path = decode2text

     service decode2text {
       executable = script /usr/lib/dovecot/decode2text.sh
       user = vmail
       unix_listener decode2text {
         mode = 0666
       }
     }


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_driver
   :plugin: fts
   :values: dovecot, solr, flatcurve

   Configures the used fts driver to perform FTS indexing.
   The :dovecot_plugin:ref:`fts` filter name refers to this setting.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_search_add_missing
   :plugin: fts
   :default: body-search-only
   :values: body-search-only, yes

   Should missing mails be added to FTS indexes before search? With
   ``body-search-only`` this is done only when the search query requests
   searching message bodies, i.e. header searches are not updating the FTS
   index.

   The unindexed mails are searched without FTS, i.e. either getting the
   headers from ``dovecot.index.cache`` or by opening the emails if the headers
   aren't in cache. This may be a useful optimization if the user's client only
   uses header searches.

   Note that only the ``yes`` value guarantees consistent search results.
   Otherwise it's possible that the search results will be different
   depending on whether the search was performed via FTS index or not.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_search_read_fallback
   :default: yes
   :plugin: fts

   If FTS lookup or indexing fails, the fall back to searching without FTS
   (i.e. possibly opening all emails). This may timeout for large mailboxes
   and/or slow storage.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_header_excludes
   :added: 2.3.18
   :plugin: fts
   :values: @string

   The list of headers to, respectively, include or exclude.

   - The default is the preexisting behavior, i.e. index all headers.
   - ``includes`` take precedence over ``excludes``: if a header matches both,
     it is indexed.
   - The terms are case insensitive.
   - An asterisk ``*`` at the end of a header name matches anything starting
     with that header name.
   - The asterisk can only be used at the end of the header name.
     Prefix and infix usage of asterisk are not supported.

   Example::

     fts_header_excludes {
       Received = yes
       DKIM-* = yes
       X-* = yes
       Comments = yes
     }

     fts_header_includes {
       X-Spam-Status = yes
       Comments = yes
     }

   - ``Received`` headers, all ``DKIM-`` headers and all ``X-`` experimental
     headers are excluded, with the following exceptions:
   - ``Comments`` and ``X-Spam-Status`` are indexed anyway, as they match
     **both** the excludes and the includes. In this case, includes take
     precedence.
   - All other headers are indexed.

   Example::

     fts_header_excludes {
       * = yes
     }

     fts_header_includes {
       From = yes
       To = yes
       Cc = yes
       Bcc = yes
       Subject = yes
       Message-ID = yes
       In-* = yes
       X-CustomApp-* = yes
     }

   - No headers are indexed, except those explicitly specified in
     the includes.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_header_includes
   :added: 2.3.18
   :plugin: fts
   :seealso: @fts_header_excludes;dovecot_plugin
   :values: @string


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_index_timeout
   :default: 0
   :plugin: fts
   :values: @uint

   When the full text search backend detects that the index isn't up-to-date,
   the indexer is told to index the messages and is given this much time to do
   so. If this time limit is reached, an error is returned, indicating that
   the search timed out during waiting for the indexing to complete:
   ``NO [INUSE] Timeout while waiting for indexing to finish``.

   A value of ``0`` means no timeout.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: fts_decoder_tika_url
   :added: 2.2.13
   :plugin: fts
   :values: @string

   (previously named ``fts_tika``)
   URL for `Apache Tika <https://tika.apache.org/>`_ decoder for attachments.

   Example::

     fts_decoder_driver = tika
     fts_decoder_tika_url = http://tikahost:9998/tika/
