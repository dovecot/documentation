.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: trash
   :plugin: trash
   :values: @string

   A text file that configures the plugin's behavior. This setting is required
   for the plugin to be active.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     trash = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-trash.conf.External

   The file uses the following format:

   .. code-block:: none

     <priority> <mailbox name>

   Deletion begins with the mailbox that has the lowest priority number and
   proceeds from there.
