``zlib_save``
---------------

All of the object storage back ends should be set up to compress
index-bundle objects. Typically, gzip -6 compression is used, though other
compression algorithms are possible. The :ref:`zlib_plugin` configuration
documentation gives a list of the algorithms that are currently supported.

Example Setting:

.. code-block:: none

   zlib_save = gz


.. _plugin-zlib-setting_zlib_save_level:

``zlib_save_level``
-------------------

All of the object storage back ends should be set up to compress
index-bundle objects. Typically, gzip -6 compression is used. The level
parameter must always be from 1 to 9.

Example Setting:

.. code-block:: none
   
   zlib_save_level = 6
