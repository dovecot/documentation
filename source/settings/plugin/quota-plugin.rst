.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_root
   :values: @string

   Quota root configuration has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

     quota = <backend>[:<quota root name>[:<backend args>]]

   The quota root name is just an arbitrary string that is sent to IMAP
   clients, which in turn may show it to the user. The name has no meaning. By
   default, an empty string is used, but you may want to change that since
   some clients (Apple Mail) break and don't show quota at all then.

   You can define multiple quota roots by appending an increasing number to
   the setting label:

   .. code-block:: none

     plugin {
       quota = maildir:User quota
       quota2 = fs:Disk quota
       #quota3 = ...
     }

   Globally available arguments for ``<backend args>`` parameter:

   =============== ==========================================================
   Name            Description
   =============== ==========================================================
   ``noenforcing`` Don't try to enforce quotas by calculating if saving would
                   get user over quota. Only handle write failures.
   ``ns=<prefix>`` A separate namespace-specific quota that's shared between
                   all users.
   =============== ==========================================================

   If you want to specify multiple backend arguments, separate them with ':'
   (e.g. ``noenforcing:ns=Public/:foo:bar``).


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_exceeded_message
   :plugin: quota
   :values: @string

   The message specified here is passed on to a user who goes over quota.

   The value is either the message or the path to a file (prefixed with a
   ``<``) that will be used as the message data.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     plugin {
       quota_exceeded_message = Quota exceeded.

       # Read message from a file
       #quota_exceeded_message = </path/to/quota_exceeded_message.txt
     }


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_grace
   :default: 10%%
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_grace
   :values: @string, @size

   If set, allows message deliveries to exceed quota by this value.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_max_mail_size
   :added: v2.2.29
   :default: 0
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_max_mail_size
   :values: @uint

   The maximum message size that is allowed to be saved (e.g. by LMTP, IMAP
   APPEND or doveadm save).

   ``0`` means unlimited.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_over_flag
   :added: v2.2.16
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_overquota_flag
   :values: @string

   An identifier that indicates whether the overquota-flag is active for a
   user.

   This identifier is compared against
   :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota_over_flag_value` to determine if the
   overquota-flag should be determine to be set for the user.

   Usually, this value will be loaded via userdb.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_over_flag_lazy_check
   :added: v2.2.25
   :default: no
   :plugin: quota
   :values: @boolean

   If enabled, overquota-flag is checked only when current quota usage is
   going to already be checked.

   Can be used to optimize the overquota-flag check in case it is running too
   slowly.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_over_flag_value
   :added: v2.2.16
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_overquota_flag
   :values: @string

   The search string to match against :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota_over_flag` to
   determine if the overquota-flag is set for the user.

   Wildcards can be used in a generic way, e.g. ``*yes`` or ``*TRUE*``


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_over_script
   :added: v2.2.16
   :plugin: quota
   :values: @string

   The service script to execute if overquota-flag is wrong. Configured the
   same as :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota_warning` scripts.

   The current :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota_over_flag` value is appended as the
   last parameter.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     plugin {
       quota_over_script = quota-warning mismatch %u
     }

   .. IMPORTANT:: obox installations using ``quota_over_script`` must
                  currently also have
                  :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota_over_flag_lazy_check` enabled.
                  Otherwise the ``quota_over_flag`` checking may cause a race
                  condition with metacache cleaning, which may end up losing
                  folder names or mail flags within folders.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_rule
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_root
   :values: @string

   Quota rule configuration has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

     quota_rule = <mailbox name>:<limit configuration>

   You can define multiple quota rules by appending an increasing number to
   the setting label.

   ``*`` as the mailbox name configures the default limit, which is applied on
   top of a mailbox-specific limit if found.

   ``?`` as the mailbox name works almost like ``*``. The difference is that
   ``?`` is used only if quota backend doesn't override the limit.

   ``*`` and ``?`` wildcards can be used as a generic wildcard in mailbox
   names, so for example ``box*`` matches ``boxes``.

   The following limit names are supported:

   ============ ==============================================================
   Name         Description
   ============ ==============================================================
   ``backend``  Quota backend-specific limit configuration.
   ``bytes``    Quota limit (without suffix: in bytes). 0 means unlimited.
   ``ignore``   Don't include the specified mailbox in quota at all.
   ``messages`` Quota limit in number of messages. 0 means unlimited.
   ``storage``  Quota limit (without suffix: in kilobytes). 0 means unlimited.
   ============ ==============================================================

   Settings with a limit value support the :ref:`size` syntax as a suffix.

   Settings also support ``%`` as a suffix. Percents are relative to the
   default rule. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

     plugin {
       quota = maildir:User quota
       quota_rule = *:storage=1GB
       # 10% of 1GB = 100MB
       quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+10%%
       # 20% of 1GB = 200MB
       quota_rule3 = Spam:storage=+20%%
     }

   Note that ``%`` is written twice to escape it, because
   :ref:`config_variables` are expanded in plugin section.
   :ref:`authentication-user_database` configuration may or may not require
   this escaping.

   Backend-specific configuration currently is used only with ``Maildir++``
   quota backend. It means you can have the quota in Maildir++ format (e.g.
   ``10000000S``).


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_set
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_admin
   :values: @string

   A dictionary string where your quota limit exists and can be modified.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_vsizes
   :added: v2.2.19
   :default: no
   :plugin: quota
   :values: @boolean

   With this setting, virtual sizes rather than physical sizes are used for
   quota-related calculations.


.. dovecot_plugin:setting:: quota_warning
   :plugin: quota
   :seealso: @quota_configuration_warning_scripts
   :values: @string

   You can configure Dovecot to run an external command when user's quota
   exceeds a specified limit. Note that the warning is ONLY executed at the
   exact time when the limit is being crossed, so when you're testing you have
   to do it by crossing the limit by saving a new mail. If something else
   besides Dovecot updates quota so that the limit is crossed, the warning is
   never executed.

   Quota warning configuration has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

     quota_warning = <limit configuration> <quota-warning socket name> <parameters>

   ``limit_configuration`` is almost exactly same as for
   :dovecot_plugin:ref:`quota`, with the exception of adding ``-`` before
   the value for "reverse" warnings where the script is called when quota
   drops below the value. Usually you want to use percents instead of absolute
   limits.

   Only the command for the first exceeded limit is executed, so configure the
   highest limit first. The actual commands that are run need to be created as
   services (create a named Dovecot service and use the service name
   as the ``quota-warning socket name`` argument).

   .. note:: The percent sign (``%``) needs to be written as ``%%`` to avoid
             :ref:`variable expansion <config_variables>`.

   You can define multiple quota rules by appending an increasing number to
   the setting label.
