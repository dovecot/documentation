=====================
SQL Driver: Cassandra
=====================

Driver name ``cassandra``.

Driver for Apache Cassandra CQL server.

To compile support for this driver, you need to have DataStax C/C++ driver and headers installed.

Supported Options
=================

.. dovecot_core:setting:: connect_timeout
   :default: 5s
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @time_msecs

   Connection timeout.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: dbname
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :hdr_only: yes

   Alias for :dovecot_core:ref:`sql-cassandra;keyspace`.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: debug_queries
   :default: no
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @boolean

   Whether to log CQL queries.

   .. note:: This setting behaves differently than other boolean settings.
             The feature is enabled by presence of the keyword in connect
             string, so to disable this feature, you must remove the keyword
             completely.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: delete_consistency
   :default: local-quorum
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :seealso: @dictmap_cassandra_quorum_configuration
   :values: !:ref:`cassandra_consistency`

   Write consistency when deleting from the database.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: delete_fallback_consistency
   :default: local-quorum
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :seealso: @dictmap_cassandra_fallback_consistency
   :values: !:ref:`cassandra_consistency`

   Write consistency when deleting from the database fails with primary
   consistency.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: execution_retry_interval
   :default: 0
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :seealso: !https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/manual/core/speculative_execution/
   :values: @time_msecs

   If the driver supports speculative execution policy, configures constant
   speculative execution policy.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: execution_retry_times
   :default: 0
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :seealso: !https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/manual/core/speculative_execution/
   :values: @time_msecs

   If the driver supports speculative execution policy, configures constant
   speculative execution policy.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: heartbeat_interval
   :default: 5s
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @time

   How often to send keepalive packets to cassandra nodes.

   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Host or IP address to connect. Can appear multiple times.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: idle_timeout
   :default: 0
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @time_msecs

   How long to idle before disconnecting.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: keyspace
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Specifies the keyspace name to use.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: latency_aware_routing
   :default: no
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @boolean

   When turned on, latency-aware routing tracks the latency of queries to
   avoid sending new queries to poorly performing Cassandra nodes.

   .. note:: The feature is enabled by presence of the keyword in connect
             string, so to disable this feature, you must remove the keyword
             completely.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: log_level
   :default: warn
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: critical, error, warn, info, debug, trace

   Path where to write JSON metrics.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: num_threads
   :default: !<driver dependent>
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @uint

   Set number of IO threads to handle query requests.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: page_size
   :default: -1
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @uint

   When a query returns many rows, it can be sometimes inefficient to return
   them as a single response message. Instead, the driver can break the
   results into pages which get returned as they are needed.

   This setting controls the size of each page.

   Set to ``-1`` to disable.

   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Path to SSL certificate authority file to use to validate peer certificate.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: ssl_cert_file
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Path to a certificate file to use for authenticating against the remote
   server.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: ssl_private_key_file
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Path to private key matching
   :dovecot_core:ref:`sql-cassandra;ssl_cert_file` to use for authenticating
   against the remote server.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: ssl_verify
   :default: none
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: none, cert, cert-ip, cert-dns

   Configure the peer certificate validation method.

   Options:

   ``none``
     Disables validation.

   ``cert``
     Validate that the certificate is valid.

   ``cert-ip``
     Validate that the certificate is valid and has Common Name or Subject
     Alternate Name for the IP address.

      Alternate Name that matches PTR resource record for the server's IP
      address.

   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @string

   Username for authentication.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: version
   :default: !Depends on driver version.
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: v3, v4, v5

   Cassandra driver version to use. It is good idea to specify this to avoid
   warnings about version handshake.

   .. note:: If you want to use server-side prepared statements, you need to
             use at least ``v3``.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: warn_timeout
   :default: 5s
   :domain: sql-cassandra
   :values: @time_msecs

   Emit warning if query takes longer than this.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: write_consistency

   :seealso: @dictmap_cassandra_quorum_configuration
   :values: !:ref:`cassandra_consistency`

   Write consistency when updating or inserting to the database.


.. dovecot_core:setting:: write_fallback_consistency

   :values: !:ref:`cassandra_consistency`

   Write consistency when updating or inserting to the database fails with
   primary consistency.

Cassandra Consistency Values
============================

Consistency levels in Cassandra can be configured to manage availability versus data accuracy.

Read Consistency
----------------

For read consistency the following values are supported:

``any``
  Not supported for reads.

``local-serial``
  Allows reading the current (and possibly uncommitted) state of data without proposing a new addition or update.
  If a ``SERIAL`` read finds an uncommitted transaction in progress, it will commit the transaction as part of the read.
  Local serial is confined to datacenter.

``serial``
  Allows reading the current (and possibly uncommitted) state of data without proposing a new addition or update.
  If a ``SERIAL`` read finds an uncommitted transaction in progress, it will commit the transaction as part of the read.

``one``
  Returns a response from the closest replica, as determined by the snitch.

``two``
  Returns the most recent data from two of the closest replicas.

``three``
  Returns the most recent data from three of the closest replicas.

``local-quorum``
  Returns the record after a quorum of replicas in the current datacenter as the coordinator has reported.

``quorum``
  Returns the record after a quorum of replicas from all datacenters has responded.

``each-quorum``
  Not supported for reads.

``all``
  Returns the record after all replicas have responded. The read operation will fail if a replica does not respond.

Write/Delete Consistency
------------------------

For write and delete consistency the following values are supported:

``any``
  At least one node must succeed in the operation.

``local-serial``
  Not supported for writes.

``serial``
  Not supported for writes.

``one``
  Operation must be at least in commit log and one memory table of one replica.

``two``
  Operation must be at least in commit log and one memory table of two replicas.

``three``
  Operation must be at least in commit log and one memory table of three replicas.

``local-quorum``
  A write must be written to the commit log and memory table on a quorum of replica nodes in the same datacenter as the coordinator.

``quorum``
  A write must be written to the commit log and memory table on a quorum of replica nodes across all datacenters.

``each-quorum``
  A write must be written to the commit log and memory table on a quorum of replica nodes in each datacenter.

``all``
  A write must be written to the commit log and memtable on all replica nodes in the cluster for that partition.
