Pigeonhole Sieve: Vacation Extension
====================================

.. seealso:: :ref:`pigeonhole_extension_vacation`

Settings
--------

.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_default_period
   :default: 7d
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @time

   Specifies the default period that is used when no ``:days`` or ``:seconds``
   tag is specified.

   .. note:: The configured value must lie between
             :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_vacation_min_period` and
             :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_vacation_max_period`.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_dont_check_recipient
   :default: no
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @boolean

   This disables the checks for implicit delivery entirely. This means that
   the vacation command does not verify that the message is explicitly
   addressed at the recipient.

   Use this option with caution. Specifying ``yes`` will violate the Sieve
   standards and can cause vacation replies to be sent for messages not
   directly addressed at the recipient.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_max_period
   :default: 0
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @time

   Specifies the maximum period that can be specified for the ``:days`` tag of
   the vacation command.

   The configured value must be larger than the
   :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_vacation_min_period` setting.

   A value of ``0`` has a special meaning: it indicates that there is no upper
   limit.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_min_period
   :default: 1d
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @time

   Specifies the minimum period that can be specified for the ``:days`` and
   ``:seconds`` tags of the vacation command.

   A minimum of ``0`` indicates that users are allowed to make the Sieve
   interpreter send a vacation response message for every incoming message
   that meets the other reply criteria (refer to
   `RFC5230 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5230>`_). A value of zero is not
   recommended.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_send_from_recipient
   :default: no
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @boolean

   This setting determines whether vacation messages are sent with the SMTP
   ``MAIL FROM`` envelope address set to the recipient address of the Sieve
   script owner.

   Normally this is set to ``<>``, which is the default as recommended in the
   specification. This is meant to prevent mail loops. However, there are
   situations for which a valid sender address is required and this setting
   can be used to accommodate for those.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_vacation_use_original_recipient
   :default: no
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @boolean

   This specifies whether the original envelope recipient should be used in
   the check for implicit delivery.

   The vacation command checks headers of the incoming message, such as
   ``To:`` and ``Cc:`` for the address of the recipient, to verify that the
   message is explicitly addressed at the recipient. If the recipient address
   is not found, the vacation action will not trigger a response to prevent
   sending a reply when it is not appropriate.

   Normally only the final recipient address is used in this check. This
   setting allows including the original recipient specified in the SMTP
   session if available.

   This is useful to handle mail accounts with aliases. Use this option with
   caution: if you are using aliases that point to more than a single account,
   as senders can get multiple vacation responses for a single message.

   Use the :ref:`LDA <lda>` ``-a`` option or the LMTP/LDA
   :dovecot_core:ref:`lda_original_recipient_header` setting to make the
   original SMTP recipient available to Sieve.
