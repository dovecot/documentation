====================================
Pigeonhole Sieve: Extprograms Plugin
====================================

.. seealso:: :ref:`pigeonhole_plugin_extprograms`

.. versionadded:: v0.3

Settings
--------

.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_<extension>_bin_dir
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @string
 
Points to a directory where the plugin looks for programs (shell scripts) to
execute directly and pipe messages to. 


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_<extension>_exec_timeout
   :default: 10s
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @time

Configures the maximum execution time after which the program is forcibly
terminated. 

.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_<extension>_input_eol
   :default: crlf
   :plugin: yes
   :values: lf, crlf

Determines the end-of-line character sequence used for the data piped to
external programs.

The default is currently ``crlf``, which represents a sequence of the carriage
return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters.

This matches the
`Internet Message Format (RFC5322) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322>`_ and
what Sieve itself uses as a line ending.

Set this setting to ``lf`` to use a single LF character instead. 


.. pigeonhole:setting:: sieve_<extension>_socket_dir
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @string
 
Points to a directory relative to the Dovecot base_dir where the plugin looks
for script service sockets.
