.. versionadded:: v0.4.14

Settings
--------

.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_mailboxXXX_after
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @string

   When an IMAP event of interest occurs, this sieve script is executed after
   any user script respectively.

   This setting each specify the location of a single sieve script. The
   semantics of this setting is similar to :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_after`: the
   specified scripts form a sequence together with the user script in which
   the next script is only executed when an (implicit) keep action is
   executed.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_mailboxXXX_before
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @url

   When an IMAP event of interest occurs, this sieve script is executed before
   any user script respectively.

   This setting each specify the location of a single sieve script. The
   semantics of this setting is similar to :pigeonhole:ref:`sieve_before`: the
   specified scripts form a sequence together with the user script in which
   the next script is only executed when an (implicit) keep action is
   executed.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_mailboxXXX_causes
   :plugin: yes
   :values: APPEND, COPY, FLAG

   Only execute the administrator Sieve scripts for the mailbox configured
   with :pigeonhole:ref:`imapsieve_mailboxxxx_name` when one of the listed
   ``IMAPSIEVE`` causes apply.

   This has no effect on the user script, which is always executed no matter
   the cause.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_mailboxXXX_from
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @string

   Only execute the administrator Sieve scripts for the mailbox configured
   with :pigeonhole:ref:`imapsieve_mailboxxxx_name` when the message
   originates from the indicated mailbox.

   This setting supports wildcards with a syntax compatible with the ``IMAP
   LIST`` command, meaning that this setting can apply to multiple or even
   all ``("*")`` mailboxes.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_mailboxXXX_name
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @string

   This setting configures the name of a mailbox for which administrator
   scripts are configured.

   The ``XXX`` in this setting is a sequence number, which allows configuring
   multiple associations between Sieve scripts and mailboxes.

   The settings defined hereafter with matching sequence numbers apply to the
   mailbox named by this setting.

   The sequence of configured mailboxes ends at the first missing
   ``imapsieve_mailboxXXX_name`` setting.

   This setting supports wildcards with a syntax compatible with the ``IMAP
   LIST`` command, meaning that this setting can apply to multiple or even
   all ``("*")`` mailboxes.


.. pigeonhole:setting:: imapsieve_url
   :plugin: yes
   :values: @url

   If set, support for user Sieve scripts in IMAP is enabled.

   The value is an URL pointing to the ManageSieve server that users must use
   to upload their Sieve scripts.

   Leave this setting empty if you don't want users to have the ability to
   associate Sieve scripts with mailboxes.

   This has no effect on the administrator-controlled Sieve scripts.
