NAME

doveadm-metacache - Utility actions for Dovecot's local metacache
storage

SYNOPSIS
========

**doveadm** [**-Dv**] [**-f** *formatter*] metacache *command* [*arguments*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**doveadm metacache** can be used to run actions that interact with and
modify Dovecot's local metacache storage.

.. include:: global-options-formatter.inc

Command specific *options*:

.. include:: option-A.inc

.. include:: option-F-file.inc

.. include:: option-S-socket.inc

.. include:: option-u-user.inc


PRIORITIES
==========

There are 4 priorities for index files:

0. User root indexes (highest priority)

1. FTS indexes

2. INBOX and \\Junk folder indexes

3. other folders' indexes (lowest priority)

COMMANDS
========

metacache clean
---------------

**doveadm metacache clean** [**-A**\ \|\ **-u** *user*\ \|\ **-F**
*file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-d** *days*] [**-p** *min_priority*] [
*namespace* ]

Cleans old indexes for given users. If the indexes have not been flushed
yet this command will fail.

**-d**
   Cleans metacache only if it hasn't been modified for specified number
   of days.

**-p**
   Cleans metacache for given priority for the specified user(s).

metacache flush
---------------

**doveadm metacache flush** [**-A**\ \|\ **-u** *user*\ \|\ **-F**
*file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [**-p** *min_priority*] [**-i**] [
*namespace* ]

Flushes metacache to storage for the given user(s).

**-p**
   Only flush changes that have at least min_priority. See PRIORITIES
   for the various priorities you can use.

**-i**
   Only flush important changes.

metacache flushall
------------------

**doveadm metacache flushall** [**-a** *metacache_socket_path*] [**-f**
*userdb_field*] [**-i**] [ *user mask* ]

Flush all matching users to storage. If no mask is specified, everything
is flushed. WARNING: This can be expensive and long operation.

**-a**
   Specify alternative metacache socket. Not usually needed.

**-f**
   Use given field to match userdb. By default it's username

**-i**
   Only flush important changes.

metacache list
--------------

**doveadm metacache list** [**-a** *metacache_socket_path*] [ *user mask*
]

List current metacache for matching users. If no mask is specified,
lists all users' metacache.

Output will contain

-  The primary username

-  Alternative usernames, if configured by returning user\_\* extra
   fields from userdb

-  This corresponds to the metacache_upload_interval setting.

-  Filesystem device where the user is located in. Filesystems are
   separately tracked by metacache, although currently support for
   multiple filesystems doesn't work as well as it could.

-  Disk space used by index files of this priority in metacache.

-  UNIX timestamp of when the index files of this priority were last
   accessed in metacache.

-  "none" means the index files have no changes done locally since they
   were downloaded. "unimportant" means there are some changes, but
   nothing that couldn't be regenerated if the server crashed.
   "important" means that there are changes that would be lost in case
   of a server crash. Currently the only important change is flag
   changes.

-  Last service that accessed this user. Note that metacache clean and
   flush operations (via metacache-worker or doveadm) won't update this
   field.

-  Currently calculated weight when these indexes are cleaned up.
   Smaller numbers are cleaned up before larger numbers. Sorting the
   list output (with \|sort -n) by this field will show the order in
   which the indexes would be cleaned. The cleanup weights are
   recalculated whenever the indexes are being accessed.

**-a**
   Specify alternative metacache socket. Not usually needed.

metacache refresh
-----------------

**doveadm metacache refresh** [**-A**\ \|\ **-u** *user*\ \|\ **-F**
*file*] [**-S** *socket_path*] [ *namespace* ]

Force refreshing metacache for the given user(s) the next time it's
opened. The refresh is done for the user root index and all the folders.

metacache remove
----------------

**doveadm metacache remove** [**-a** *metacache_socket_path*] *user mask*

Remove metacache for matching users from metacache process. Mask is
required parameter.

**-a**
   Specify alternative metacache socket. Not usually needed.

metacache update userdb
-----------------------

**doveadm metacache update userdb** [**-a** *metacache_socket_path*]
*username* *userdb_field* *value*

Update alternative usernames (user\_\* fields) in **doveadm metacache
list** output.

metacache unpack
----------------

**doveadm metacache unpack** *bundle_file* *destination_dir*

Unpack given bundle from storage to a given directory.

metacache pull
--------------

**doveadm metacache pull** [**-A**\ \|\ **-u** *user*] [**-S**
*socket_path*] [**---latest-only**] [**---clean**] *source_backend_host*

Pull all metacache for given user(s) from source backend host.

**--clean**
   Metacache is cleaned for the user(s) that have been successfully
   pulled.

**--latest-only**
   Pulling fails if there are newer bundles in storage than at source
   backend host.
