TLS SNI Client Support

Works:

-  Thunderbird (Linux)

-  K-9 on Android (merged Sept 2015 -
   `<https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/pull/718>`__)

-  Apple Mail (according to
   `<https://forums.cpanel.net/threads/mail-ssl-sni.454592/>`__ )

-  Mutt (according to `<https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/-/blob/master/README.SSL>`__ )

-  NeoMutt (since 2016-03-07 according to
   `<https://www.neomutt.org/feature/tls-sni>`__)

Doesn't work:

-  K-9 on Droid X2 (maybe fixed in newer versions - see above)

-  Apple Mail (Mac OS X 10.10 and lower AND iOS 9.3 and lower)

-  Outlook for Mac version 15 (according to
   `<https://forums.cpanel.net/threads/mail-ssl-sni.454592/>`__ )
