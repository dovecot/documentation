Virtualised Dovecot instances
===============================

Dovecot can be run directly on physical hardware or virtualised using various virtualisation technologies. 

Some customers are using OpenStack, some using KVM or WMware, we are in the end agnostic to the virtualisation technology used, as long as there is no overcommitment of resources as explained more in detail in.
