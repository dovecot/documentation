   :field last_used: UNIX timestamp of when the field was accessed the last
     time. This is updated only once per 24 hours.
   :field reason:
     Reason why the caching decision changed:
       * ``add``: no -> temp decision change, because a new field was added to
         cache.
       * ``old_mail``: temp -> yes decision change, because a mail older than
         1 week was accessed.
       * ``unordered_access``: temp -> yes decision change, because mails
         weren't accessed in ascending order.
       * Other values indicate a reason for cache purging, which changes the
         caching decision yes -> temp.
   :field uid: IMAP UID number that caused the decision change. This is set

       * rebuilding index

.. dovecot_core:event:: mail_cache_decision_rejected

   :field field: Cache field name (e.g. ``hdr.from``).
   :field reason:

     error field is present).

   Transaction is finished or failed.


Recipient
---------

.. dovecot_event:field_group:: smtp_recipient
   :inherit: smtp_transaction

   :field rcpt_to: Recipient address.
   :field rcpt_param_notify: The value of the NOTIFY parameter for the RCPT
     command.
   :field rcpt_param_orcpt: The address value of the ORCPT parameter for the
     RCPT command.
   :field rcpt_param_orcpt_type: The address type (typically "rfc822") of the
     ORCPT parameter for the RCPT command.
   :field session: Session ID for this transaction and recipient. It is based
     on the ``transaction_id`` with a ":<seq>" recipient sequence number
     suffix. Only available for LMTP currently.


.. dovecot_core:event:: smtp_server_transaction_rcpt_finished
   :inherit: smtp_recipient

   :field status_code: SMTP status code for the reply. This is = 9000 for
     aborted transactions (e.g., when the connection is closed prematurely).
   :field enhanced_code: SMTP enhanced status code for the reply. This is
     "9.0.0" for aborted transactions (e.g., when the connection is closed
     prematurely).
   :field error: Error message for the reply if it is a failure. There is no
     field for a success message.
   :field dest_host @added;2.4.0,3.0.0: LMTP proxying only: Proxy destination
     hostname
   :field dest_ip @added;2.4.0,3.0.0: LMTP proxying only: Proxy destination IP
     address

   The transaction is finished or failed for this particular recipient. When
   successful, this means the DATA command for the transaction yielded success
   for that recipient (even for SMTP this event is generated for each
   recipient separately). Recipients can fail at various stages, particularly
   at the actual RCPT command where the server can deny the recipient.

   :field pending_save: Number of message saves pending completion.
   :field pending_copy: Number of message copies pending completion.

   Obox is throttling the number of concurrent saves/copies.

   This event is used to expose externally the status of the internal parallelism,
   i.e. to let tests asses if we can actually reach the degree of parallelism
   expected through :dovecot_plugin:ref:`obox_max_parallel_writes` and
   :dovecot_plugin:ref:`obox_max_parallel_copies` or instead anything chokes the
   performance to less optimal levels.


fs-dictmap
----------

.. dovecot_core:event:: fs_dictmap_dict_write_uncertain
   :added: 2.3.13
   :inherit: fs_file

   :field path: Virtual FS path to the object (based on dict).
   :field object_id: Object ID in the storage.

     uncertain write was attempted to be cleaned (deleted) and whether it was
     successful. See :ref:`dictmap_configuration_parameters`.
   :field error: Error message why the write initially failed.

   A dictionary write is uncertain (e.g., writes to Cassandra may
   eventually succeed even if the write initially appeared to fail).

   See also :dovecot_core:ref:`fs_object_write_uncertain` event.


.. dovecot_core:event:: fs_dictmap_object_lost
   :added: 2.3.10
   :inherit: fs_file

   :field path: Virtual FS path to the object (based on dict).
   :field object_id: Object ID in the storage.
   :field deleted @added;2.3.15: Set to ``yes``, if the corresponding entry
     in dict has been deleted as the ``delete-dangling-links`` option was set
     (:ref:`dictmap_configuration_parameters`).

   "Object exists in dict, but not in storage" error happened.

   Normally this shouldn't happen, because the writes and deletes are
   done in such an order that Dovecot prefers to rather leak objects in storage
   than cause this error. A likely source of this error can be resurrected
   deleted data (see :ref:`cassandra` for more details).


.. dovecot_core:event:: fs_dictmap_max_bucket_changed
   :added: 2.3.13
   :inherit: fs_file, fs_iter

     event.
   :field old_max_bucket: The ``max_bucket`` value for the current mailbox,
     before the event was emitted.
   :field max_bucket: The newly set ``max_bucket`` value.
   :field error: Error string if error occurred. Only set if setting the new
     ``max_bucket`` value failed.

   This event is sent whenever the ``max_bucket`` value for a mailbox changes.
   There can be three situations when this happens.

     * A new mail is added to a mailbox, where the current bucket is found to
       be filled and the next bucket is started to be filled
       (``reason = file``).

     * Besides the expected situation, Dovecot emits this event if it
       encounters a bucket with a higher index then the current ``max_bucket``
       while iterating a mailbox (``reason = iter``).

     * .. dovecotchanged:: 2.3.14 In addition ``max_bucket`` can be shrunk in
                           case an iteration discovers empty buckets before
                           the current ``max_bucket`` value
                           (``reason = iter``).


.. dovecot_core:event:: fs_dictmap_empty_bucket_iterated
   :added: 2.3.14
   :inherit: fs_iter

   :field empty_bucket: Index of the empty bucket that was just discovered.
   :field max_bucket: The current ``max_bucket`` value.
   :field deleted_count: The count of deleted keys for the empty bucket.

   Nn empty bucket is found while iterating which is not the last bucket.

.. dovecot_core:event:: fs_object_write_uncertain
   :added: 2.4.0,3.0.0
   :inherit: fs_file

   :field cleanup: ``success`` or ``failed``. Indicates if uncertain write
     was cleaned (deleted) successfully             |
   :field error: Error message why the write initially failed.

   Sent whenever an object write is uncertain.

   When a write HTTP operation times out actual outcome is uncertain.

   See also :dovecot_core:ref:`fs_dictmap_dict_write_uncertain` event.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Reason
     - Description
   * - ``anonymous_auth_disabled``
     - Anonymous authentication is not allowed.
   * - ``authorization_failed``
     - Master user authentication succeeded, but authorization to access the requested login user wasn't allowed.
   * - ``auth_aborted_by_client``
     - Client started SASL authentication, but returned "*" reply to abort it.
   * - ``auth_failed``
     - Generic authentication failure. Possibly due to invalid username/password, but could have been some other unspecified reason also.
   * - ``auth_nologin_referral``
     - Authentication returned auth referral to redirect the client to another server. This is normally configured to be sent only when the client is a Dovecot proxy, which handles the redirection.
   * - ``auth_process_comm_fail``
     - Internal error communicating with the auth process.
   * - ``auth_process_not_ready``
     - Client disconnected before auth process was ready. This may indicate a hanging auth process if ``connected_usecs`` is large.
   * - ``auth_waiting_client``
     - Client started SASL authentication, but disconnected instead of sending the next SASL continuation reply.
   * - ``cleartext_auth_disabled``
     - Authentication using cleartext mechanism is not allowed at this point. It would be allowed if SSL/TLS was enabled.
   * - ``client_ssl_cert_untrusted``
     - Client sent an SSL certificate that is untrusted with :dovecot_core:ref:`auth_ssl_require_client_cert` set to ``yes``
   * - ``client_ssl_cert_missing``
     - Client didn't send SSL certificate, but :dovecot_core:ref:`auth_ssl_require_client_cert` is set to ``yes``
   * - ``client_ssl_not_started``
     - Client didn't even start SSL with :dovecot_core:ref:`auth_ssl_require_client_cert` set to ``yes``
   * - ``internal_failure``
     - Internal failure. The error log has more details.
   * - ``invalid_base64``
     - Client sent invalid base64 in SASL response.
   * - ``invalid_mech``
     - Unknown SASL authentication mechanism requested.
   * - ``login_disabled``
     - The user has the :ref:`nologin<authentication-nologin>` field set in passdb and is thereby not able to login.
   * - ``no_auth_attempts``
     - Client didn't send any authentication attempts.
   * - ``password_expired``
     - The user's password is expired.
   * - ``process_full``
     - :dovecot_core:ref:`service_client_limit` and :dovecot_core:ref:`service_process_limit` was hit and this login session was killed.
   * - ``proxy_dest_auth_failed``
     - Local authentication succeeded, but proxying failed to authenticate to the destination hop.
   * - ``shutting_down``
     - The process is shutting down so the login is aborted.
   * - ``user_disabled``
     - User is in deny passdb, or in some other way disabled passdb.

     - Local authentication succeeded, but proxying failed to authenticate to the destination hop.
   * - ``proxy_dest_auth_temp_failed``
     - Local authentication succeeded, but proxying failed to temporarily authenticate to the destination hop.
