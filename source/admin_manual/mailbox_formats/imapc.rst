====================
Imapc Mailbox Format
====================

The imapc storage accesses a remote IMAP server as if it were a regular
(local) Dovecot mailbox format. Dovecot can treat it as a dummy storage or
optionally a more capable storage.

For information on how to configure imapc in Dovecot, see
:ref:`imapc_settings`.
