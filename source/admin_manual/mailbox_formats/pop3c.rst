====================
Pop3c Mailbox Format
====================

The pop3c storage accesses a remote POP3 server as if it were a regular
(local) Dovecot mailbox format. Dovecot can treat it as a dummy storage or
optionally a more capable storage.

For information on how to configure pop3c in Dovecot, see
:ref:`pop3c_settings`.
